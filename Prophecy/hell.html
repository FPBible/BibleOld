<h1>Hell</h1>
<h2>Judgment Language in Its Biblical Context</h2>

<p class="note">
The English word “hell” does not represent a single biblical concept.
It is a later theological umbrella that collapses several distinct
Scripture terms into one imagined place.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Words Translated as “Hell”</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sheol</strong> — the grave / realm of the dead (Hebrew)</li>
  <li><strong>Hades</strong> — the grave / unseen realm (Greek)</li>
  <li><strong>Gehenna</strong> — a real valley outside Jerusalem, used as a judgment symbol</li>
</ul>

<p>
None of these words describe an eternal torture chamber.
They function as **judgment, death, or destruction imagery** within Israel’s covenant world.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Gehenna: Jesus’ Primary Judgment Term</h2>

<p>
Jesus uses “Gehenna” when speaking to first-century Jews.
It refers to the Valley of Hinnom — a known site of idolatry,
defilement, and judgment in Israel’s history.
</p>

<p>
When Jesus warns of Gehenna, He is not threatening post-mortem torment.
He is warning of **covenant judgment on Jerusalem** —
a destruction that would fall on that generation
if the leadership continued in rebellion.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Hell Is Not About the Afterlife</h2>

<p>
The Bible’s primary concern is not where people go when they die,
but how covenant faithfulness or rebellion
results in life or destruction within history.
</p>

<p>
“Hell” language belongs to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>judgment on nations</li>
  <li>destruction of systems</li>
  <li>removal of corrupt leadership</li>
  <li>exposure of false security</li>
</ul>

<p>
Reading these texts as metaphysical geography
misses their prophetic function.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Fulfillment</h2>

<p>
Jesus’ warnings about fire, destruction, and Gehenna
were fulfilled in the judgment that fell on Jerusalem in the first century.
The temple system ended.
The city was destroyed.
The covenant order passed away.
</p>

<p>
“Hell” language did its job:
it warned,
it judged,
and it passed.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
“Hell” is not a place God sends people forever.
It is prophetic judgment language
used to announce the end of a corrupt covenant world.
