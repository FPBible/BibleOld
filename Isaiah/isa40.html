<h1>Isaiah</h1>

<h2>Chapter 40 — Comfort, Return, and the End of Exile</h2>

<h3>Comfort Announced</h3>

<p>
“Comfort, comfort My people,”
says your God.
“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
and cry to her
that her warfare is ended,
that her iniquity is pardoned,
that she has received from the LORD’s hand
double for all her sins.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Voice in the Wilderness</h3>

<p>
A voice cries out:
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD;
make straight in the desert
a highway for our God.
Every valley will be lifted up,
every mountain and hill made low;
the uneven ground will become level,
and the rough places a plain.
The glory of the LORD will be revealed,
and all flesh will see it together,
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:3–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Permanence of God’s Word</h3>

<p>
A voice says, “Cry!”
And I said, “What shall I cry?”
“All flesh is grass,
and all its faithfulness is like the flower of the field.
The grass withers, the flower fades
when the breath of the LORD blows upon it;
surely the people are grass.
The grass withers, the flower fades,
but the word of our God stands forever.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:6–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>The LORD Comes as Shepherd</h3>

<p>
Go up on a high mountain,
O Zion, herald of good news;
lift up your voice with strength,
O Jerusalem, herald of good news;
lift it up, do not fear;
say to the cities of Judah,
“Behold your God!”
Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might,
and His arm rules for Him.
Behold, His reward is with Him,
and His recompense before Him.
He will tend His flock like a shepherd;
He will gather the lambs in His arms,
and carry them in His bosom,
and gently lead those that are with young.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:9–11)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Incomparable Creator</h3>

<p>
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand
and marked off the heavens with a span,
enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure,
and weighed the mountains in scales
and the hills in a balance?
Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD,
or as His counsellor has instructed Him?
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:12–14)</a>
</p>

<p>
The nations are like a drop from a bucket,
and are counted as the dust on the scales.
All the nations are as nothing before Him;
they are accounted by Him as less than nothing and emptiness.
To whom then will you liken God,
or what likeness compare with Him?
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:15–18)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Folly of Idols</h3>

<p>
An idol? — a craftsman casts it,
a goldsmith overlays it with gold,
and casts for it silver chains.
He who is too impoverished for an offering
chooses wood that will not rot;
he seeks out a skilful craftsman
to set up an idol that will not move.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:19–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>The LORD Enthroned Over All</h3>

<p>
Do you not know?
Do you not hear?
Has it not been told you from the beginning?
It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,
and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;
who brings princes to nothing,
and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:21–23)</a>
</p>

<p>
Lift up your eyes on high and see:
who created these?
He who brings out their host by number,
calling them all by name;
by the greatness of His might
and because He is strong in power,
not one is missing.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:26)</a>
</p>

<h3>Strength for the Weary</h3>

<p>
Why do you say, O Jacob,
and speak, O Israel,
“My way is hidden from the LORD,
and my right is disregarded by my God”?
Have you not known?
Have you not heard?
The LORD is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the earth.
He does not faint or grow weary;
His understanding is unsearchable.
He gives power to the faint,
and to him who has no might He increases strength.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:27–29)</a>
</p>

<p>
Even youths shall faint and be weary,
and young men shall fall exhausted;
but those who wait for the LORD
shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings like eagles;
they shall run and not be weary;
they shall walk and not faint.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:30–31)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 40</h2>

<h3>1) “Comfort” signals covenant resolution, not delay</h3>
<p>
Isaiah opens the second half of the book with comfort, not threat.
The warfare is declared finished.
In New Covenant terms, this anticipates reconciliation accomplished,
not postponed.
This is why the New Testament treats Isaiah 40 as fulfilled-entry language.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) The wilderness voice prepares for divine arrival in flesh</h3>
<p>
All four Gospels identify this voice with John the Baptist.
The “way of the LORD” is not a road project —
it is the preparation for God’s personal arrival.
The glory revealed is ultimately Christ Himself,
seen by “all flesh.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:3–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “All flesh is grass” relativises human authority</h3>
<p>
Isaiah contrasts fragile human systems with the permanence of God’s word.
Kings, empires, priesthoods, and traditions wither.
The New Creation stands because it rests on God’s spoken faithfulness,
not human durability.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:6–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) The Shepherd imagery reframes divine power</h3>
<p>
Isaiah’s God comes in strength,
yet carries lambs gently.
This anticipates Jesus’ redefinition of kingship:
authority expressed through care.
The New Covenant ruler gathers rather than crushes.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:9–11)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Creation language establishes God’s unmatched authority</h3>
<p>
Isaiah is not teaching cosmology.
He is declaring sovereignty.
No nation, ruler, or system can rival the Creator.
This is the theological foundation for trusting God
during covenant transition and upheaval.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:12–26)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Idols fail because they cannot act or speak</h3>
<p>
Isaiah exposes idols as human-made and immobile.
They require maintenance.
By contrast, the living God speaks, acts, and sustains.
This critique anticipates the gospel’s exposure
of both religious and political idols.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:19–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Waiting on the LORD is active trust, not passivity</h3>
<p>
To “wait” is to remain aligned with God’s promise
when circumstances appear unchanged.
Isaiah does not promise escape from weariness,
but renewal within it.
This is New Covenant endurance rooted in trust,
not in human stamina.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA40.htm">(Isa 40:31)</a>
</p>

<p>
Isaiah 40 marks the turning point:
exile declared ended,
the LORD on the way,
human systems exposed,
and strength promised to those who trust.
It is the doorway into the gospel age.
