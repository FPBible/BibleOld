<h1>John 17</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
Jesus said these things, then lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, â€œFather, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;<br/>
even as you gave him authority over all flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.<br/>
This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.<br/>
I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.<br/>
Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.<br/>
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.<br/>
Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,<br/>
for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me.<br/>
I pray for them. I donâ€™t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.<br/>
All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.<br/>
I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.<br/>
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. I have kept those whom you have given me. None of them is lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.<br/>
But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.<br/>
I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br/>
I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.<br/>
They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.<br/>
Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.<br/>
As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.<br/>
For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.<br/>
Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who will believe in me through their word,<br/>
that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.<br/>
The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;<br/>
I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me and loved them, even as you loved me.<br/>
Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.<br/>
Righteous Father, the world hasnâ€™t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.<br/>
I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.â€

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The Father, in the presence of the disciples</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The sealing prayer before the cross, completing the transition from old covenant to New Creation</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> This prayer defines eternal life, unity, glory, and mission in covenantâ€”not institutionalâ€”terms.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) Eternal life is knowing God</h3>
<p>Eternal life is not endless duration after death. It is covenant relationship â€” shared life with the Father through the Son.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>Glory located in temple, nation, ethnicity, and separation between God and people.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Shared glory, shared life, and shared unity rooted in union with Christ.</p>
<h3>4) â€œBefore the world existedâ€</h3>
<p>This language reaches behind the old covenant order to Godâ€™s eternal purpose now revealed in the Son. It does not require modern cosmology; it expresses covenant priority and origin.</p>
<h3>5) Unity is the witness</h3>
<p>The oneness Jesus prays for is not organizational agreement but shared participation in divine life. This unity testifies that the mission succeeded.</p>
<h3>6) Not taken out of the world</h3>
<p>The disciples are not removed from history. They remain present during the covenant collapse, bearing witness as the old order passes away.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This prayer is answered through resurrection, Pentecost, apostolic mission, and the public end of the temple system in AD 70. The unity and glory Jesus prayed for stand completed.</p>

<h2>Key Idioms &amp; Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glory</strong> â€” revealed covenant presence</li>
<li><strong>Eternal life</strong> â€” shared life with God</li>
<li><strong>World (kosmos)</strong> â€” covenant order opposed to Christ</li>
<li><strong>One</strong> â€” shared participation, not uniformity</li>
<li><strong>Sanctified</strong> â€” set apart into truth</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>God dwelling with His people</strong> â€”

<hr/>
<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>You are already included in the prayer Jesus prayed. His unity, glory, and life are not future goals â€” they are present realities in Christ.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>If eternal life is knowing God now, where might you still be postponing what is already yours?</p>
