      </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Revelation opens by establishing authority, audience, and time-frame before any
          judgment imagery appears. Chapters 1–5 set the foundation for everything that follows:
          who is speaking, to whom, and who truly governs history.
        </p>
        <p>
          These chapters are not predictions. They are disclosure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Revelation 1 — The revelation of Jesus Christ</h2>
        <p>
          The book begins by identifying its source and scope. This is a revelation from Jesus
          Christ, concerning events that would happen <em>soon</em>, and the time is described as
          <em>near</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These statements govern the entire book. Revelation is anchored in the lived experience
          of its original audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus is presented as the faithful witness, firstborn from the dead, and ruler of the
          kings of the earth. His authority is already established, not awaited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The “coming with the clouds” language draws from Old Testament judgment imagery and is
          directed toward those responsible for rejecting and piercing Him. This is covenant
          judgment language, not a description of a physical descent through the sky.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Revelation 2–3 — The seven churches</h2>
        <p>
          The messages to the seven churches address real communities facing real pressures:
          persecution, compromise, fear, and spiritual complacency.
        </p>
        <p>
          These chapters reveal why Revelation was written. The churches are called to endurance,
          faithfulness, and discernment in the face of imminent trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each letter follows a consistent pattern: Christ’s authority, the church’s condition,
          a call to repentance or perseverance, and a promise of vindication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revelation is pastoral before it is dramatic. The visions that follow serve these
          communities, not a distant future audience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Revelation 4 — The throne in heaven</h2>
        <p>
          Chapter 4 shifts the reader’s perspective from earthly pressure to heavenly rule.
          God is shown seated on the throne, surrounded by worship and authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          This vision establishes that history is not chaotic or uncontrolled. Before seals are
          opened and judgments unfold, the throne is already occupied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imagery reflects Old Testament throne-room scenes and communicates sovereignty,
          not spatial geography.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Revelation 5 — The Lamb and the scroll</h2>
        <p>
          The sealed scroll represents authority over unfolding events. No one is found worthy
          to open it until the Lamb appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lamb is described as slain yet standing. Victory comes through sacrifice, not force.
          This sets the pattern for how judgment and triumph operate throughout the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Lamb takes the scroll, heaven responds with worship. What follows in Revelation
          flows from this moment: the rightful authority to bring covenant judgment and transition
          belongs to Christ.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Summary (1–5)</h2>
        <p>
          Revelation begins by grounding everything in authority, audience relevance, and divine
          sovereignty. Before seals, trumpets, or beasts appear, the reader is shown who rules,
          why the churches are addressed, and how victory is achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          These chapters ensure Revelation is read as a message of assurance and vindication for
          first-century believers, not a source of fear or speculation.
        </p>
