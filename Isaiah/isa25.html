      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Following the terrifying "de-creation" of the Old Covenant Land in chapter 24, Isaiah 25 bursts forth as a song of spectacular victory. If Isaiah 24 is the tearing down of the old order, Isaiah 25 is the joyous celebration of the new. The prophet sees a time when Yahweh establishes a magnificent feast on Mount Zion. Most shockingly for an Old Covenant Jewish audience, this feast is not restricted to Israel; it is prepared for "all peoples." At this feast, God promises to destroy the veil separating the nations, swallow up death forever, and wipe away all tears. This chapter is the absolute bedrock for the New Testament's doctrine of the resurrection and the New Jerusalem.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>This Mountain:</strong> Represents the true Mount Zion, the New Covenant Kingdom (Hebrews 12:22), not a literal dirt hill in the Middle East.</li>
        <li><strong>The Veil Destroyed:</strong> Fulfilled legally at the cross when the temple veil tore, and consummated in AD 70 when the physical barrier of the Old Covenant system was removed, granting all nations access to God.</li>
        <li><strong>Death Swallowed Up:</strong> Quoted directly by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:54. This is the defeat of spiritual, covenantal death (the curse of Adam), not the cessation of biological aging.</li>
        <li><strong>Moab Trodden Down:</strong> Moab represents the proud, carnal enemies of God's grace who are thoroughly humiliated and judged as the Kingdom rises.</li>

        <li><strong>city into a heap</strong> (v. 2) — The overarching prophetic motif of the "City of Man" (apostasy, Babylon, and ultimately the apostate Jerusalem) being destroyed to make way for the City of God.</li>

        <li><strong>wipe away tears</strong> (v. 8) — The ultimate comfort of covenant reconciliation. The grief of separation from God is permanently healed.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Two Cities (vv. 1–5)</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter opens with praise because God has turned a "fortified city into a ruin" (v. 2). Throughout Isaiah, there is a recurring tale of two cities: the proud, self-reliant city of human opposition (often characterized as Babylon or Moab), and the faithful City of God (Zion). By the time we reach the New Testament, apostate Jerusalem has aligned herself with the "City of Man" (spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, Rev 11:8). The destruction of the oppressive, persecuting city provides a "refuge from the storm" (v. 4) for the faithful remnant.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Feast for All Nations (v. 6)</h3>
      
      <p>
        On "this mountain" (Zion), God prepares a feast. Under the Old Covenant, access to God's presence was strictly regulated by genealogy, physical purity, and temple borders. Gentiles were excluded under penalty of death. But Isaiah envisions a radical shift: a feast for <strong>all peoples</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus fulfills this in the Gospels. He constantly uses the imagery of a great banquet to describe the Kingdom (Luke 14), warning that the original invitees (Israel according to the flesh) would be cast out, and the poor, the lame, and the Gentiles would be brought in. The Eucharist (Communion) is the ongoing, visible participation in this exact mountain feast of the New Covenant.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Tearing the Veil (v. 7)</h3>
      
      <p>
        "He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations." 
      </p>
      <p>
        This veil is multifaceted. First, it is the veil of spiritual blindness and condemnation that rested on humanity since Adam. Second, it was physically represented by the thick curtain in the Jewish Temple that blocked access to the Holy of Holies. When Christ was crucified, that physical veil was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51), signaling that the barrier was legally broken. In AD 70, when the Temple was burned to the ground, the veil was permanently, historically destroyed. The way into the Holiest of All was made manifest (Hebrews 9:8).
      </p>

      <h3>4) Swallowing Up Death Forever (v. 8)</h3>
      <p>
        This is the most critical verse in the chapter: <em>"He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We must define "death" biblically. When God told Adam he would die in the day he ate the fruit (Gen 2:17), Adam did not drop biologically dead that Tuesday; he died <em>covenantally and spiritually</em>. He was exiled from God's presence. The entire biblical narrative is about defeating this separation-death. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle Paul quotes Isaiah 25:8 directly in 1 Corinthians 15:54: "Death is swallowed up in victory." Paul tells us exactly what this death is: "The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law" (1 Cor 15:56). The death being swallowed up is the death weaponized by the Old Covenant Law. When the Law system was finally removed at the end of the age (AD 70), the power of that death was permanently broken. Believers now pass from biological life into the immediate presence of God. Spiritual death is gone. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, the Apostle John quotes this verse in Revelation 21:4: "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more." This is not a promise that New Covenant Christians won't experience biological sadness; it is the covenantal promise that the grief, exile, and mourning of the Old Covenant separation have been permanently reversed.
      </p>

      <h3>5) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        Futurism forces this text to conform to modern, biological expectations. We must strip those away to see the glory of what Christ accomplished.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a promise of biological immortality. Believers still undergo physical death, but physical death has lost its "sting" (separation from God).</li>
          <li>It is <strong>not</strong> a promise of a future utopian society where human beings never cry biological tears of sadness.</li>
          <li>It is <strong>not</strong> about a literal feast of physical meat and wine to be held in modern-day Jerusalem. It is the spiritual reality of union with Christ.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) The Covenant Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        The resolution of Isaiah 25 is the total victory of the Gospel. The proud, carnal system (represented by Moab in the dunghill, vv. 10-12) is crushed and humiliated. Meanwhile, the faithful who "waited for Him" (v. 9) during the tumultuous transition period are vindicated. The New Jerusalem is established. The feast is served. Access is open to every tribe, tongue, and nation. The reproach of the people is gone forever.

      <p>
        This chapter calls you to live from the joy of the Feast. You are not waiting on the outskirts of the mountain hoping for an invitation at the end of time. The veil has been torn. The covering of condemnation is destroyed. The death that separated humanity from the Father has been swallowed up in the victory of Christ. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> You have full, unrestricted access to the Father. Pull up a chair to the table and rejoice in His salvation.

      <h2>10. Historical/Covenantal Fulfillment</h2>
      <p>The historical events of the first century vindicated Isaiah's vision:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Cross (AD 30):</strong> The legal defeat of sin and death, physically marked by the tearing of the veil in the Herodian Temple.</li>
        <li><strong>The Gospel Explosion:</strong> Following Pentecost, the "feast" was immediately extended to the Gentiles (Samaritans, Ethiopians, Romans, Greeks), proving the "covering over all nations" was being lifted.</li>
        <li><strong>The Consummation (AD 70):</strong> The complete destruction of the physical Temple and the genealogical records forever ended the Old Covenant system of separation. The "high fortress of walls" was brought to the dust, leaving the spiritual New Jerusalem as the only remaining, unshakable reality.</li>
