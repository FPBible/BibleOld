<h1>Revelation 21</h1>
<h2>New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV21.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 21 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 20 closed the account of the old covenant world:
death, Hades, accusation, and condemnation removed.
Revelation 21 does not introduce a future universe replacement.
It reveals the New Covenant reality that emerges once the old order has passed.
This chapter is covenantal, not cosmological.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>New Heaven and New Earth (21:1–4)</h3>
<p>
John sees a new heaven and a new earth,
because the former heaven and earth have passed away.
The sea—symbol of chaos and separation—is no more.
</p>
<p>
The holy city, New Jerusalem, comes down from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
A loud voice declares that God now dwells with His people.
Tears, death, mourning, and pain belong to the former order
and have no place in this new reality.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>“It Is Done” — Covenant Completion (21:5–8)</h3>
<p>
The One on the throne declares:
“I am making all things new.”
These words are trustworthy and true.
</p>
<p>
The inheritance belongs to those who overcome.
The fearful and faithless remain outside this life,
not because of future torment,
but because they cling to the old order that has passed away.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> “New heaven and new earth” is prophetic language
for covenant renewal (Isaiah 65–66),
fulfilled in the New Covenant transition,
not a promise of planetary destruction and replacement.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Bride Revealed: The New Jerusalem (21:9–14)</h3>
<p>
An angel shows John the bride—the wife of the Lamb.
She is the holy city descending from God,
radiant with His glory.
</p>
<p>
Her gates bear the names of the twelve tribes,
and her foundations the names of the twelve apostles.
Israel’s story and the apostolic witness are united in one people.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Measured, Secure, and Filled with Glory (21:15–21)</h3>
<p>
The city is measured to show perfection, completeness, and security.
Its imagery is symbolic, not architectural.
Its beauty reflects covenant value, not material wealth.
</p>
<p>
The city shines with God’s glory.
There is no darkness, no exclusion, and no corruption within it.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>God’s Immediate Presence (21:22–27)</h3>
<p>
There is no temple in the city,
because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
</p>
<p>
The city needs no sun or moon.
God’s presence provides light.
The nations walk by that light,
and nothing unclean enters.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Heaven and earth are covenant structures</h3>
<p>
Throughout Scripture, “heaven and earth” function as covenant language.
Their passing signals the end of the Mosaic world.
Their renewal signals the New Covenant order established in Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) The sea’s removal means access restored</h3>
<p>
The sea often symbolises separation and unrest.
Its absence means no barrier between God and humanity.
Access is open, permanent, and secure.
</p>

<h3>3) New Jerusalem is a people, not a location</h3>
<p>
The city is explicitly called the bride.
It represents the covenant community formed in Christ.
This is identity language, not urban planning.
</p>

<h3>4) No temple means direct presence</h3>
<p>
Temple absence is not loss—it is fulfilment.
God no longer dwells in mediated structures.
He dwells with and within His people.
</p>

<h3>5) Exclusion language is covenantal, not punitive</h3>
<p>
Those “outside” are aligned with the former order.
Revelation is not describing eternal torture,
but the incompatibility of old covenant identity
with New Creation life.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 21 describes where we live now in Christ.
God is not distant.
Access is not fragile.
Identity is not temporary.
New Creation life is lived from presence, not pursuit.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where do I still think of God as distant or access as conditional?
What would change if I lived today
as someone already dwelling in the New Jerusalem?
