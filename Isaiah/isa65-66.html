<h1>Isaiah</h1>
<h2>Chapters 65–66 — New Heavens, New Earth, New Covenant People</h2>

<h3>God Sought by the Nations</h3>

<p>
I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for Me;
I was ready to be found by those who did not seek Me.
I said, “Here I am, here I am,”
to a nation that was not called by My name.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA65.htm">(Isa 65:1)</a>
</p>

<h3>Old Covenant Resistance</h3>

<p>
I spread out My hands all the day
to a rebellious people,
who walk in a way that is not good,
following their own devices.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA65.htm">(Isa 65:2)</a>
</p>

<h3>A New Creation Announced</h3>

<p>
“For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth,
and the former things shall not be remembered
or come into mind.
But be glad and rejoice forever
in that which I create.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA65.htm">(Isa 65:17–18)</a>
</p>

<p>
No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days,
or an old man who does not fill out his days;
for the young man shall die a hundred years old,
and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA65.htm">(Isa 65:20)</a>
</p>

<h3>Peace and Restoration</h3>

<p>
They shall build houses and inhabit them;
they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
They shall not build and another inhabit;
they shall not plant and another eat.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA65.htm">(Isa 65:21–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;
the lion shall eat straw like the ox;
they shall not hurt or destroy
in all My holy mountain.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA65.htm">(Isa 65:25)</a>
</p>

<h3>True Worship Redefined</h3>

<p>
Thus says the LORD:
“Heaven is My throne,
and the earth is My footstool.
What is the house that you would build for Me?
All these things My hand has made.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA66.htm">(Isa 66:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Birth of a New People</h3>

<p>
Before she was in labour she gave birth;
before her pain came upon her
she delivered a son.
Shall a land be born in one day?
Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment?
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA66.htm">(Isa 66:7–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>Worldwide Gathering</h3>

<p>
“I will gather all nations and tongues,
and they shall come and see My glory.
They shall declare My glory among the nations.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA66.htm">(Isa 66:18–19)</a>
</p>

<p>
From new moon to new moon,
and from Sabbath to Sabbath,
all flesh shall come to worship before Me,
declares the LORD.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA66.htm">(Isa 66:23)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 65–66</h2>

<p>
“New heavens and new earth” is **covenantal language**, not astrophysics.
Isaiah describes a **new order of life**, not a new planet.
Death still exists, time still passes — proving this is not the end of physical reality,
but the end of an old covenant world.
</p>

<p>
The chapter contrasts two groups:
those clinging to old religious identity
and those God calls from outside expected boundaries.
This is fulfilled as Gentiles enter covenant life
while old-covenant resistance collapses.
</p>

<p>
Temple language is dismantled.
God no longer locates Himself in buildings,
but among the humble and receptive.
This anticipates the New Covenant reality
where God dwells in people.
</p>

<p>
The sudden birth of a nation is fulfilled
in the emergence of the Church —
a people brought forth not by law,
but by promise.
</p>

<p>
Isaiah ends not with destruction,
but with **global worship, peace, and continuity**.
The New Creation is stable, enduring,
and centred on God’s presence with His people.
