  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 15 — Abiding in the True Vine</h2>

  <h3>The True Vine</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “I am the true vine,
    and My Father is the vinedresser.
    Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit
    He removes,
    and every branch that does bear fruit
    He prunes,
    so that it may bear more fruit.
    You are already clean
    because of the word I have spoken to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:1–3)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Abide in Me,
    and I in you.
    Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
    unless it abides in the vine,
    neither can you,
    unless you abide in Me.
    I am the vine;
    you are the branches.
    Whoever abides in Me
    and I in him,
    he bears much fruit,
    for apart from Me
    you can do nothing”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:4–5)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If anyone does not abide in Me,
    he is thrown away like a branch and withers.
    Such branches are gathered,
    thrown into the fire,
    and burned.
    If you abide in Me,
    and My words abide in you,
    ask whatever you wish,
    and it will be done for you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:6–7)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “By this My Father is glorified:
    that you bear much fruit
    and so prove to be My disciples”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:8)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Abiding Love</h3>

  <p>
    “As the Father has loved Me,
    so have I loved you.
    Abide in My love.
    If you keep My commandments,
    you will abide in My love,
    just as I have kept My Father’s commandments
    and abide in His love.
    These things I have spoken to you
    so that My joy may be in you,
    and that your joy may be full”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:9–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This is My commandment:
    that you love one another
    as I have loved you.
    Greater love has no one than this:
    that someone lay down his life for his friends.
    You are My friends
    if you do what I command you.
    I no longer call you servants,
    for the servant does not know what his master is doing;
    but I have called you friends,
    for everything I heard from My Father
    I have made known to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:12–15)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You did not choose Me,
    but I chose you
    and appointed you
    that you should go and bear fruit
    and that your fruit should remain,
    so that whatever you ask the Father in My name,
    He may give it to you.
    These things I command you,
    so that you will love one another”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:16–17)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The World’s Hatred</h3>

  <p>
    “If the world hates you,
    know that it has hated Me before it hated you.
    If you were of the world,
    the world would love you as its own;
    but because you are not of the world,
    but I chose you out of the world,
    therefore the world hates you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:18–19)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Remember the word that I said to you:
    ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’
    If they persecuted Me,
    they will also persecute you.
    If they kept My word,
    they will also keep yours”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:20)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But all these things they will do to you
    on account of My name,
    because they do not know Him who sent Me.
    If I had not come and spoken to them,
    they would not have sin;
    but now they have no excuse for their sin.
    Whoever hates Me hates My Father also”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:21–23)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If I had not done among them the works that no one else did,
    they would not have sin.
    But now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.
    But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled:
    ‘They hated Me without a cause’”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA035.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ps 35:19)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:24–25)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Witness of the Spirit</h3>

  <p>
    “When the Helper comes,
    whom I will send to you from the Father —
    the Spirit of truth,
    who proceeds from the Father —
    He will bear witness about Me.
    And you also will bear witness,
    because you have been with Me from the beginning”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:26–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 15</h2>

  <h3>1. The “true vine” replaces Israel as covenant source</h3>
  <p>
    Israel was repeatedly described as God’s vine
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA080.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ps 80:8)</a>.
    Jesus now declares Himself the true vine.
    Covenant life no longer flows through Torah or ethnicity,
    but through union with Him.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Pruning is covenant judgment, not believer insecurity</h3>
  <p>
    Pruning language
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:2)</a>
    echoes prophetic covenant-judgment imagery.
    In a fulfilled lens,
    this is the removal of unfruitful branches from the old covenant order,
    not anxious self-monitoring by believers.
  </p>

  <h3>3. “Already clean” establishes present standing</h3>
  <p>
    “You are already clean”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:3)</a>
    means the relationship is already real.
    Abiding is living from what is already true,
    not striving to become acceptable.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Fire language belongs to covenant transition</h3>
  <p>
    Fire imagery
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:6)</a>
    matches prophetic warnings like
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT03.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Matt 3:10)</a>:
    historical judgment on an unfruitful system,
    not a post-mortem threat.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Hatred confirms the age-change</h3>
  <p>
    The world’s hatred
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:18)</a>
    confirms that New Creation people no longer belong to the old power structures.
  </p>

  <h3>6. The Spirit witnesses to a finished Christ</h3>
  <p>
    The Spirit’s role
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN15.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 15:26)</a>
    is testimony—bearing witness to what has been revealed and accomplished.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 15 describes life inside the New Creation:
    the vine stands complete,
    the branches live,
    fruit flows,
    and the old world is being cut away.
  </p>
