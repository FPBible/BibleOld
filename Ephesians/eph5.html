<h1>Ephesians 5</h1>
<h2>Walking as Light · Living in Love · Wisdom for the New Humanity</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Living as Imitators of God (Eph 5:1–7)</h2>

<p><strong>5:1–2</strong> Therefore, be imitators of God, as beloved children, and walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us — a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</p>

<p><strong>5:3–7</strong> Sexual immorality, impurity, or greed must not even be named among you, as is fitting for holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking — which are out of place — but rather thanksgiving. For you know this: no immoral, impure, or greedy person — who is an idolater — has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath comes on the sons of disobedience. Therefore, do not become partners with them.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — From Darkness to Light (Eph 5:8–14)</h2>

<p><strong>5:8–10</strong> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light — for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth — testing what is pleasing to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>5:11–14</strong> Do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things they do in secret. But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, sleeper, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Walking Wisely in the Present Age (Eph 5:15–21)</h2>

<p><strong>5:15–17</strong> Look carefully, then, how you walk — not as unwise but as wise — making the most of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.</p>

<p><strong>5:18–21</strong> And do not get drunk with wine, which leads to recklessness, but be filled by the Spirit — speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Covenant-Shaped Relationships (Eph 5:22–33)</h2>

<p><strong>5:22–24</strong> Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church — He Himself being the Savior of the body. As the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</p>

<p><strong>5:25–27</strong> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that He might present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and blameless.</p>

<p><strong>5:28–30</strong> In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church — because we are members of His body.</p>

<p><strong>5:31–33</strong> “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This mystery is profound, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 5 continues the “walk” section by showing how New Creation life
looks when love, light, and wisdom shape behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Paul is not shifting into law.
He is describing congruence:
how those who are light live as light.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) Imitation flows from sonship</h3>
<p>
Believers imitate God not to become children,
but because they already are beloved children.
Identity precedes action.
</p>

<h3>2) Sacrifice language points back to Christ, not forward</h3>
<p>
Christ’s self-giving is the pattern.
There is no call to repeat or add to His sacrifice —
only to live from its shape: love that gives itself.
</p>

<h3>3) “Wrath” language remains covenantal</h3>
<p>
Paul warns against returning to patterns belonging to a judged world.
This is not fear-mongering.
It is clarity: old patterns belong to an old order.
</p>

<h3>4) Light exposes by presence, not aggression</h3>
<p>
Light does not shout.
It reveals.
Paul’s call is to live transparently enough
that darkness cannot hide.
</p>

<h3>5) “Awake, sleeper” is resurrection imagery</h3>
<p>
This echoes prophetic calls to covenant awakening.
It is about moving from death-world thinking
into New Creation life.
</p>

<h3>6) Wisdom is situational faithfulness</h3>
<p>
Paul’s concern is not abstract morality.
It is discerning how to live well
within a collapsing old world.
</p>

<h3>7) Being filled with the Spirit is communal</h3>
<p>
Spirit-filled life is expressed through gratitude,
shared worship,
and mutual submission —
not private spiritual intensity.
</p>

<h3>8) Marriage reflects Christ’s covenant love</h3>
<p>
Paul reframes household roles around Christ’s self-giving.
Headship is defined by sacrifice,
not domination.
This protects the vulnerable
and reorders power.
</p>

<h2>Prophecy Fulfilment</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 5 assumes fulfillment:
light has come,
the old darkness is exposed,
and covenant relationships are being reshaped around Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>

<p>
Living as light does not mean policing others.
It means embodying clarity, love, and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
The question is not “What rules must I keep?”
It is “Does my life reflect the love that gave itself for me?”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might I still be managing appearances
instead of letting the light of Christ shape how I live,
speak, and love?
</p>
