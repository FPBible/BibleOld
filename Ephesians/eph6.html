<h1>Ephesians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 6 — Standing in a Finished Victory</h2>

<p><em>
Ephesians 6 does not announce a coming war.
It teaches how to live firmly within Christ’s completed victory,
resisting deception and accusation in everyday life.
</em></p>

<h3>Household Faithfulness</h3>

<p>
Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
for this is right.
“Honour your father and mother”
— which is the first commandment with a promise —
“so that it may go well with you
and you may live long in the land.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:1–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger,
but bring them up in the instruction and guidance of the Lord.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:4)</a>
</p>

<h3>Service Transformed by the Lordship of Christ</h3>

<p>
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and sincerity of heart,
as you would Christ —
not by way of eye-service,
as people-pleasers,
but as servants of Christ,
doing the will of God from the heart,
serving with goodwill as to the Lord and not to people,
knowing that whatever good anyone does,
this he will receive back from the Lord,
whether slave or free.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:5–8)</a>
</p>

<p>
Masters, do the same to them,
and stop threatening,
knowing that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven,
and there is no partiality with Him.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:9)</a>
</p>

<h3>Strength from the Lord</h3>

<p>
Finally, be strong in the Lord
and in the strength of His might.
Put on the whole armour of God,
so that you may be able to stand
against the schemes of the accuser.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:10–11)</a>
</p>

<p>
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
but against rulers,
against authorities,
against the powers of this present darkness,
against spiritual forces of evil
in the heavenly realm.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:12)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Armour: Living from What Is True</h3>

<p>
Therefore take up the whole armour of God,
so that you may be able to withstand in the evil day,
and having done everything, to stand.
Stand therefore,
having fastened the belt of truth,
having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
and having fitted your feet with the readiness
that comes from the gospel of peace.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:13–15)</a>
</p>

<p>
In all circumstances take up the shield of faithfulness,
with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one;
and take the helmet of salvation,
and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word spoken by God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:16–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>Prayer as Posture, Not Panic</h3>

<p>
With every kind of prayer and request,
pray at all times in the Spirit,
staying alert with all perseverance,
making requests for all the saints —
and also for me,
that words may be given to me
in opening my mouth boldly
to make known the mystery of the gospel,
for which I am an ambassador in chains,
so that I may declare it boldly,
as I ought to speak.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:18–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>Final Encouragement</h3>

<p>
So that you also may know how I am
and what I am doing,
Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord,
will tell you everything.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose,
that you may know how we are,
and that he may encourage your hearts.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:21–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
Peace be to the brothers,
and love with faith,
from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ
with an undying love.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:23–24)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 6</h2>

<h3>1) Standing assumes victory</h3>
<p>
Paul never tells believers to advance, conquer, or defeat.
He tells them to stand.
You only stand when the decisive victory has already been secured.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:11,13)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) The “powers” are systems of authority and accusation</h3>
<p>
These are not comic-book villains.
They are spiritualised systems —
religious, political, and ideological —
that operate through fear, condemnation, and deception.
Christ’s reign exposes and limits their claim.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:12)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Armour is lived reality, not ritual gear</h3>
<p>
Truth, righteousness, peace, and faithfulness
are not tools to be activated.
They are realities to be inhabited.
The armour describes a way of being,
not a battle technique.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:14–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Prayer keeps orientation, not anxiety</h3>
<p>
Prayer here is not panic preparation.
It is ongoing alignment —
remaining awake, grounded, and confident
as ambassadors of reconciliation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:18–20)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 6 closes the letter by grounding believers
in calm, resilient faithfulness —
standing firm in a world already claimed by Christ.
