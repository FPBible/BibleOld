Instruction:
Generate the full HTML code for the next chapter of ANY Bible book (Genesis–Revelation) using the LOCKED FPBible Chapter HTML Standard (Revelation 1–style structure/nav/CSS) and the rules below.

THEOLOGICAL LENS (SITE AUDIT COMPLIANT):
- You MUST write all framing, notes, and commentary from a consistent Covenantal / Full Preterist perspective.
- Zero Futurism: if a passage sounds “still pending,” you must explain its fulfillment in the first-century covenant transition (AD 30–70), or (for OT) as fulfilled in Christ and/or the covenant transition.
- “The End” = end of the Mosaic age (AD 70).
- “The Coming / Parousia” = Christ’s vindication/judgment on Jerusalem and covenantal transition.
- “The Kingdom” = present, settled New Creation reality now.
- Do NOT use “already but not yet” language.
- Audience relevance is mandatory: state who is being addressed and why the timing statements are time-bound.

TEXT INTEGRITY (WEB — SOURCE LOCKED):
- Scripture MUST be the World English Bible (WEB) text, copied verbatim.
- Source of truth for copying text: https://ebible.org/web/BOOK##.htm (e.g., https://ebible.org/web/MAT03.htm).
- DO NOT paraphrase, rewrite, modernize, harmonize, or adjust wording/punctuation.
- No mixing translations (WEB only).
- Selective Bolding: within the Scripture text, apply <strong> ONLY to the exact words/phrases supplied in the Annotations list. Nothing else gets bolded.

LINK RULES:
- Cross-References MUST link to WEB on eBible.org using:
  https://ebible.org/web/BOOK##.htm (e.g., https://ebible.org/web/ISA40.htm)
- Prophecy Hub links MUST be internal:
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/index.html#anchor">Theme Name</a>

FORMAT + TEMPLATE:
1) Output valid HTML5.
2) Use the LOCKED Revelation-1 style internal CSS and layout (cards/sections/nav/buttons) — do NOT use external CSS.
3) Include top navigation and bottom navigation consistent with the locked FPBible standard (Bible Index + Book Index + Previous/Next chapter links).

FILE + TITLE RULES:
- Use correct <title> and <h1> format:
  “{Book} {Chapter} — {Short Covenant-Themed Subtitle}”
- Use correct internal Prev/Next file links consistent with the repo naming scheme for that book.
- Do NOT invent folder names. If folder naming is unknown, use the existing pattern in that book (e.g., /Bible/{Book}/book1.html) and keep it consistent within the output.

REQUIRED SECTION ORDER (each separated by <hr />):
1. Immediate Context
   - One short paragraph setting the scene in the book’s covenant-litigation / redemptive-historical flow (no fluff).

2. Scripture (WEB)
   - Full chapter text in <div class="scripture-text">.
   - Verse numbers wrapped in <span class="v-num">.
   - Apply selective bolding only per Annotations list.

3. Fulfillment Notes (STRICT)
   - EXACTLY 3–5 lines total.
   - Each line = ONE sentence only.
   - No mini-commentary, no quotes, no “maybe.”
   - Must explicitly sharpen timing where relevant (“this generation,” “near,” “at hand,” “soon,” “in a little while,” etc.).
   - For OT chapters: state the covenant fulfillment trajectory (Christ, Cross, New Covenant, AD 70) without futurist drift.

4. Annotations
   - Gray/soft box listing key terms and brief definitions (1–2 lines each).
   - Include covenant idioms relevant to the chapter (e.g., “heaven and earth,” “coming on clouds,” “day of the LORD,” “wilderness,” “vineyard,” “outer darkness,” “Babylon,” “Beast,” etc.) without bloated essays.
   - The terms/phrases listed here define the ONLY phrases that receive <strong> in Scripture.

5. Fulfillment Commentary (DEPTH REQUIRED)
   - Minimum 700 words (900+ preferred if the chapter is dense).
   - Break into numbered subheadings.
   - Must connect imagery to covenant realities: Law/Temple/Priesthood/Sacrifice/Israel’s leadership/judgment-transfer/New Creation access.
   - Must state the first-century resolution plainly (AD 70 context where applicable).
   - Must avoid repeating the Fulfillment Notes verbatim.
   - Must explicitly reject futurist assumptions when the passage is commonly misread futuristically.

6. Prophecy Hub Links
   - Bullet list of exactly 3 relevant internal themes (use existing hub anchors; do not invent new anchors unless instructed).

7. Cross-References
   - Bullet list of exactly 3 WEB links (OT/NT mix as appropriate).

8. New Creation Reality
   - Short, grounded: what this means now (presence, access, identity, Spirit-life).
   - No fear-based application. No condemnation tone.

9. Reflection
   - One challenging devotional question (not moralistic, not fear-based).

10. Footer
   - Prev/Next + Bible Index + Book Index links
   - Official Ko-fi button: https://ko-fi.com/B0B61QC1BU
   - Extended WEB attribution note (as per site standard)

QUALITY CONTROL (HARD FAIL CONDITIONS):
- If Scripture text is not verifiably WEB from eBible, do NOT output guessed Scripture.
- Do NOT output paraphrased Scripture.
- Do NOT include futurist “still pending” implications.
- Do NOT exceed 5 Fulfillment Notes lines.
- Do NOT bold anything in Scripture that is not listed in Annotations.

Task:
Generate the full HTML for: [BOOK NAME] [CHAPTER NUMBER].
Also include:
- Correct <title> and <h1> format: “{Book} {Chapter} — [Short Covenant-Themed Subtitle]”
- Correct internal Prev/Next file links consistent with the repo naming scheme.
