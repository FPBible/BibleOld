  <h1>End of the Age</h1>
  <h2 class="muted">Mosaic Age Close · Temple Order Ended · New Covenant Publicly Vindicated</h2>

  <p>
    “The end of the age” in the Gospels is not the end of the planet.
    It is the end of a covenant administration — the Mosaic age centered in Torah, priesthood, and temple.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1) What “Age” Means in the Bible’s Covenant Frame</h2>
  <p>
    In the New Testament, “age” language often refers to an ordered covenant world: how access, worship, authority,
    and identity are administered. The Mosaic covenant had a defined lifetime and a defined “end” built into the prophets:
    the Messiah would come, the covenant would be fulfilled, and the old system would be removed.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2) Why Matthew 24 Locks the Meaning</h2>
  <p>
    Matthew 24 begins at the temple, stays in the temple’s judgment context, and includes local flight commands in Judea.
    Then it time-locks fulfillment with “this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.”
    That combination makes “end of the age” covenantal and first-century — not a distant global finale.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3) The “End” Is the End of Mosaic Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>
    When the New Covenant is established in Christ, the old covenant’s legal jurisdiction is replaced:
    priesthood, sacrifice, calendar, and temple-centered access are no longer the governing order.
    The cross inaugurates the New Covenant reality; the first-century judgment on Jerusalem publicly ends the rival house.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4) “The End” and “The Coming” Are Covenant-Verdict Language</h2>
  <p>
    “Coming” language in these contexts functions as royal vindication and covenant judgment (prophetic idiom),
    not “Jesus is doing sky travel.” The point is public reversal: the rejected Messiah is vindicated as enthroned,
    and the old persecuting order is judged.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5) New Creation Reality</h2>
  <p>
    If the Mosaic age has ended, you are not living in a mixed-admin era — part old, part new.
    You live in the settled New Covenant: open access, unshakable kingdom, Spirit-life now.
    The “end” is not looming over you; it is behind you as covenant history.
  </p>
