<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Pursue Love; Let Speech Build (14:1–5)</h3>

<p>
Pursue love,
and eagerly desire spiritual expressions —
especially that you may speak in ways that build others.
</p>

<p>
The one who speaks in a tongue
speaks not to people but to God —
no one understands them,
they are speaking mysteries by the spirit.
</p>

<p>
But the one who speaks prophetically
speaks to people for strengthening,
encouragement, and comfort.
</p>

<p>
The one who speaks in a tongue builds themselves;
the one who speaks prophetically builds the assembly.
</p>

<p>
I want all of you to speak in tongues,
but even more that you speak prophetically.
The one who speaks prophetically
is greater than the one who speaks in tongues —
unless interpretation is given,
so the assembly is built up.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Understanding Is Essential (14:6–12)</h3>

<p>
If I come to you speaking in tongues,
how will I benefit you
unless I bring revelation,
knowledge,
prophecy,
or teaching?
</p>

<p>
Even lifeless instruments —
a flute or harp —
if they do not give distinct notes,
how will anyone recognise the tune?
</p>

<p>
If a trumpet gives an unclear sound,
who will prepare for battle?
</p>

<p>
So it is with you:
unless your speech is intelligible,
how will anyone know what is being said?
You will be speaking into the air.
</p>

<p>
There are many kinds of languages in the world,
and none is without meaning.
But if I do not understand the meaning,
I am a foreigner to the speaker,
and the speaker a foreigner to me.
</p>

<p>
So since you are eager for spiritual expressions,
seek to excel in those that build the assembly.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Prayer, Mind, and Community Awareness (14:13–19)</h3>

<p>
For this reason,
the one who speaks in a tongue
should pray that they may interpret.
</p>

<p>
If I pray in a tongue,
my spirit prays,
but my mind is unfruitful.
</p>

<p>
So what is the outcome?
I will pray with the spirit,
and I will pray with the mind also.
I will sing with the spirit,
and I will sing with the mind also.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise,
if you bless with the spirit,
how can someone in the place of the uninstructed
say “Amen” to your thanksgiving,
since they do not know what you are saying?
</p>

<p>
You may be giving thanks well enough,
but the other person is not being built up.
</p>

<p>
I thank God that I speak in tongues
more than all of you.
But in the assembly
I would rather speak five understandable words
to instruct others
than ten thousand words in a tongue.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Maturity Replaces Spectacle (14:20–25)</h3>

<p>
Brothers and sisters,
do not be children in your thinking.
Be infants in evil,
but mature in your understanding.
</p>

<p>
In the Law it is written:
“By people of other tongues
and by the lips of foreigners
I will speak to this people,
yet even then they will not listen to Me.”
</p>

<p>
So tongues function as a sign —
not for believers,
but for unbelievers.
Prophetic speech, however,
is not for unbelievers but for believers.
</p>

<p>
If the whole assembly comes together
and everyone speaks in tongues,
and uninstructed or unbelieving people enter,
will they not say you are out of your mind?
</p>

<p>
But if everyone speaks prophetically,
and an unbeliever or uninstructed person enters,
they are convicted,
examined by all,
</p>

<p>
the secrets of their heart are exposed,
and so they fall on their face
and acknowledge that God is truly among you.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Order Reflects God’s Nature (14:26–33)</h3>

<p>
So what follows, brothers and sisters?
When you come together,
each one has a psalm,
a teaching,
a revelation,
a tongue,
an interpretation.
Let all things be done for building up.
</p>

<p>
If anyone speaks in a tongue,
let there be two or at most three,
each in turn,
and let one interpret.
</p>

<p>
If there is no interpreter,
let them remain silent in the assembly
and speak to themselves and to God.
</p>

<p>
Let two or three speak prophetically,
and let the others weigh what is said.
</p>

<p>
If a revelation comes to another who is seated,
the first should stop speaking.
</p>

<p>
For you can all prophesy one by one,
so that all may learn
and all be encouraged.
</p>

<p>
The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
For God is not a God of disorder,
but of peace —
as in all the assemblies of the saints.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Peaceful Participation, Not Suppression (14:34–40)</h3>

<p>
As in all the assemblies,
women are not to disrupt the gatherings.
They are to be in submission,
as the Law also says.
</p>

<p>
If they wish to learn something,
let them ask their own husbands at home,
for it is shameful for a woman
to disrupt the assembly.
</p>

<p>
Did the word of God originate with you?
Or did it reach only you?
</p>

<p>
If anyone thinks they are a prophet or spiritual,
let them recognise
that what I am writing to you
is the Lord’s instruction.
</p>

<p>
If anyone ignores this,
they are to be ignored.
</p>

<p>
So then, my brothers and sisters,
eagerly desire to speak prophetically,
and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
</p>

<p>
But let everything be done
properly and in an orderly way.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Corinth is confusing spiritual vitality with noise and spectacle.
Paul does not extinguish spiritual expression —
he matures it.
Love governs gifts,
and edification defines legitimacy.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Tongues and prophecy serve a transitional purpose</h3>
<p>
These expressions operate within the already-arrived New Covenant community
to establish, instruct, and unify.
They are not proof of spiritual rank,
but tools for corporate formation during covenant maturity.
</p>

<h3>2) “Sign for unbelievers” reflects covenant warning</h3>
<p>
Tongues echo Isaiah’s warning language —
foreign speech signalling judgment on hardened hearers.
This is covenantal, not mystical spectacle.
</p>

<h3>3) Order reveals God’s presence</h3>
<p>
Paul grounds order in God’s character.
Chaos does not display freedom;
it obscures presence.
Peaceful intelligibility reflects the New Creation reality.
</p>

<h3>4) Participation is regulated, not suppressed</h3>
<p>
Paul’s restrictions aim at clarity and honour,
not silencing.
Everyone contributes —
but no one dominates.
</p>

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Build up”:</strong> the governing criterion for all spiritual expression.</li>
  <li><strong>“Sign”:</strong> covenant indicator, not entertainment.</li>
  <li><strong>“Peace”:</strong> God’s active ordering presence.</li>
  <li><strong>“Orderly”:</strong> intelligible, participatory, and loving structure.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
The New Creation is not loud to prove it is alive.
It speaks clearly,
serves humbly,
and builds people up.
Love gives structure,
and structure protects love.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might expression be replacing edification —
and how can love reshape the way I speak and participate?
</p>
