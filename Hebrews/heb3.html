<h1>Hebrews 3</h1>
<h2>The Son Greater Than Moses · Do Not Harden Your Hearts</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Jesus Greater Than Moses (Hebrews 3:1–6)</h2>

<p><strong>3:1–2</strong> Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus — the apostle and high priest of our confession — who was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house.</p>

<p><strong>3:3–4</strong> Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honour than the house itself. Every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.</p>

<p><strong>3:5–6</strong> Moses was faithful as a servant in God’s house, to testify about things that would later be spoken. But Christ is faithful as a Son over God’s house — and we are His house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — A Warning from Israel’s History (Hebrews 3:7–11)</h2>

<p><strong>3:7–9</strong> Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, where your fathers tested Me and saw My works for forty years.”</p>

<p><strong>3:10–11</strong> “Therefore I was angry with that generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways.’ As I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest.’”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Exhortation to Persevere (Hebrews 3:12–19)</h2>

<p><strong>3:12–13</strong> Take care, brothers and sisters, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. Encourage one another daily — while it is still called “today” — so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</p>

<p><strong>3:14–15</strong> We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. As it is said: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”</p>

<p><strong>3:16–19</strong> For who heard and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? With whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Hebrews 3 directly confronts the temptation to retreat to Moses.
The audience is being pulled back toward the covenant mediator they know best.
The author responds sharply: Moses was faithful — but Moses was never the goal.
</p>

<p>
The wilderness generation becomes a living warning:
having begun well does not guarantee finishing well
if trust is abandoned at the moment of testing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Moses was faithful — but temporary</h3>
<p>
Hebrews does not attack Moses.
It relativises him.
Moses served within a house that pointed forward.
The Son owns and completes the house.
</p>

<h3>2) “House” is covenant identity language</h3>
<p>
The house is not a building.
It is the covenant people.
To return to Moses is to abandon the house that God is now building in Christ.
</p>

<h3>3) “Today” is not timeless — it is urgent</h3>
<p>
“Today” marks the narrow window in which this letter is written.
The decision cannot be postponed.
The old covenant is still standing — but not for long.
</p>

<h3>4) Hardening happens through familiarity</h3>
<p>
Israel did not reject God outright.
They slowly trusted Him less.
Unbelief in Hebrews is not atheism —
it is preferring what feels safe over what God is doing now.
</p>

<h3>5) Sin deceives by promising security</h3>
<p>
The deceitfulness of sin here is covenantal.
The Law promises stability while quietly denying access to life.
What once served now enslaves.
</p>

<h3>6) Rest is forward-looking, not backward-looking</h3>
<p>
The wilderness generation looked back to Egypt.
The Hebrews audience is tempted to look back to the temple.
Both miss the promised rest that lies ahead in God’s unfolding work.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Hebrews 3 strips nostalgia of its power.
Faith is not loyalty to the past —
it is trust in what God is doing now.
</p>

<p>
You are not a servant trying to hold a place in the house.
You are part of the house the Son is building.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be tempted to retreat into what feels familiar —
instead of trusting the Son who leads beyond it?
</p>
