      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Revelation 19 is a chapter of supreme vindication. In Chapter 18, the apostate Harlot (Jerusalem) was judged and her city was burned. Now, the scene shifts from the funeral of the unfaithful wife to the wedding feast of the faithful Bride. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The chapter opens with a massive "Hallelujah" chorus in heaven, celebrating the fact that the blood of the martyrs has finally been avenged. Following the wedding announcement, heaven opens to reveal Christ as the ultimate, victorious King, riding a white horse. He goes forth to crush the Beast and the False Prophet, completely dismantling the Roman persecuting power that had terrorized the first-century church.

      <div class="scripture-text">
        <span class="v-num">1</span> After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God;<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> for his judgments are true and righteous. For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">3</span> A second said, “Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “Amen! Hallelujah!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> A voice came from the throne, saying, “Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> Let’s rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let’s give the glory to him. For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> He said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb.’” He said to me, “These are true words of God.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me, “Look! Don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">11</span> I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war.<br />
        <span class="v-num">12</span> His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself.<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is called “The Word of God.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">14</span> The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, pure, fine linen.<br />
        <span class="v-num">15</span> Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.<br />
        <span class="v-num">16</span> He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">17</span> I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, “Come! Be gathered together to the great supper of God,<br />
        <span class="v-num">18</span> that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, and small and great.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">19</span> I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.<br />
        <span class="v-num">20</span> The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.<br />
        <span class="v-num">21</span> The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came forth out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Marriage is Fulfilled (v. 7):</strong> Under the Old Covenant, God was "married" to Israel. But Israel repeatedly played the harlot and broke the covenant. Now that the unfaithful Harlot has been officially judged and divorced (AD 70), the New Covenant Bride (the Church) is legally presented as the pure, faithful wife. The marriage supper is not a future, physical banquet in the sky; it is the present, realized communion of the Church with Christ.</li>
        <li><strong>The Rider on the White Horse (v. 11):</strong> This is not a literal, physical return of Jesus riding an animal out of the stratosphere. It is a highly symbolic vision of Christ's sovereign, historical judgment. The weapon He uses is not a physical sword in His hand, but the "sword of His mouth"—the absolute authority of His spoken decree.</li>
        <li><strong>The Beast and False Prophet Defeated (v. 20):</strong> The Roman persecuting power (Beast) and the local Imperial Cult/Jewish enforcers (False Prophet) were historically stripped of their power to destroy the Church. They were thrown into the "lake of fire" (the prophetic idiom for total, irreversible defeat and removal from history).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hallelujah</strong> — This is the only chapter in the New Testament where the word "Hallelujah" (Praise Yahweh) is used. It is sung specifically because God’s justice has been executed against the persecutors of His people.</li>
        <li><strong>garment sprinkled with blood (v. 13)</strong> — Christ's robe is covered in blood <em>before</em> the battle even begins. This points directly to the cross. He conquers not by shedding the blood of others with a physical sword, but through the power of His own atoning sacrifice.</li>
        <li><strong>the great supper of God (v. 17)</strong> — A stark, gruesome contrast to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. While the righteous feast in covenant fellowship, the enemies of God become a feast for the scavengers, fulfilling the prophecy of Ezekiel 39.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Hallelujah Chorus (vv. 1–5)</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter opens with the roaring sound of heaven celebrating the fall of Babylon. For modern readers, rejoicing over the destruction of a city seems harsh. But the martyrs under the altar (Rev 6) had been crying out for justice for years. The Harlot had "corrupted the earth" and slaughtered the innocent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When God finally stepped into history in AD 70 and brought that corrupt system to an end, it proved that He is faithful to His promises. The "Hallelujah" is not bloodlust; it is the deep, profound relief that righteousness and truth actually govern the universe, and that evil does not get the final word.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Marriage of the Lamb (vv. 6–10)</h3>
      <p>
        The contrast between the Harlot and the Bride is absolute. The Harlot dressed herself in the gaudy, ostentatious wealth of the old temple (purple, gold, jewels). The Bride is dressed in "pure, fine linen," which the text explicitly identifies as "the righteous acts of the saints." 
      </p>
      <p>
        This marriage is the fulfillment of the entire biblical narrative. The time of waiting is over. The New Covenant is fully inaugurated. When the angel tells John, "Blessed are those invited to the wedding supper," John is so overwhelmed by the glory of the New Creation reality that he falls down to worship the angel. The angel sharply rebukes him: "Don't do it! Worship God." All prophecy points to Jesus, not angels.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Rider on the White Horse (vv. 11–16)</h3>
      <p>
        Futurists often point to this passage and say, "See! This is the Second Coming at the end of the world." But look closely at the imagery. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Jesus is not coming down to establish a political kingdom on earth; He is coming forth as the "Word of God" to execute judgment. The sword is coming out of His <em>mouth</em>. This means His judgment is executed by His sovereign decree. He speaks, and history obeys. 
      </p>
      <p>
        He is followed by the armies of heaven, but notice that the armies are not wearing armor or carrying weapons. They are dressed in "fine linen, white and pure." You do not fight a physical military battle wearing white linen. This is a spiritual conquest. The battle was already won at the cross (His robe is already dipped in blood). Now, He is simply enforcing that victory in history.
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Defeat of the Beast (vv. 17–21)</h3>
      <p>
        The Beast (the Roman Empire) and the Kings of the Earth (the local rulers of Judea and the provinces) gathered together to make war against Christ. How did they do this? By persecuting His Church. To attack the Body is to attack the Head (as Jesus told Paul on the Damascus road: "Why do you persecute <em>Me</em>?").
      </p>
      <p>
        The battle is entirely anti-climactic. There is no long, drawn-out struggle. The Beast and the False Prophet are simply "taken" and thrown into the lake of fire. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In apocalyptic language, the "lake of fire" is the cosmic incinerator. It means total, permanent removal from history and authority. The Roman imperial persecution was broken. The Jewish persecution was broken. Their power was entirely consumed by the judgment of God, leaving the Church victorious and expanding across the known world.

      <p>
        You do not have to wait for the Marriage Supper of the Lamb; the table is already set, and you are already seated at it. The Bride has been made ready through the righteous acts of Christ given to you. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> The persecuting powers of the first century were decisively judged and thrown into the fire. The King of Kings is actively ruling history right now, and His word is the ultimate, final authority over every earthly kingdom.
