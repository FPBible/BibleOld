LOCKED FPBible Chapter HTML Standard — Tightened (Audit-Proof)

Instruction:
Generate the full HTML code for the next chapter of ANY Bible book (Genesis–Revelation) using the LOCKED FPBible Chapter HTML Standard (Revelation-1 style structure/nav/CSS) and the rules below.

0) NON-NEGOTIABLE BRANDING RULE
- Do NOT use the words “Paraphrase Bible” or “Paraphrase” anywhere in the page (title, headings, nav, body, footer, metadata).
- Use only FPBible / Fulfilled Bible wording if naming is needed.

1) THEOLOGICAL LENS (SITE AUDIT COMPLIANT)
- All framing, notes, and commentary MUST be consistently Covenantal / Full Preterist.
- Zero Futurism: If a passage is commonly treated as “still pending,” you MUST state its fulfillment:
  - NT: in the first-century covenant transition AD 30–70 (explicitly mention AD 70 where applicable).
  - OT: fulfilled in Christ (Cross/New Covenant) and/or in the covenant transition climaxing in AD 70, without futurist drift.
- Definitions (locked):
  - “The End” = end of the Mosaic age (AD 70).
  - “Coming / Parousia” = Christ’s covenantal vindication/judgment on Jerusalem leading to transition (AD 70).
  - “Kingdom” = present, settled New Creation reality now.
- Banned phrasing:
  - No “already but not yet” language.
  - No “still to be fulfilled” implication.
- Audience relevance is mandatory: identify who is addressed and why time-markers are time-bound (e.g., “this generation,” “near,” “soon”).

2) TEXT INTEGRITY (WEB — SOURCE LOCKED) — PRIMARY GATE
Hard gate: If Scripture cannot be verified as WEB from eBible, do not output guessed text.
- Scripture MUST be World English Bible (WEB) copied verbatim.
- Source of truth for Scripture text:
  https://ebible.org/web/BOOK##.htm (e.g., https://ebible.org/web/MAT03.htm)
- Prohibitions:
  - DO NOT paraphrase, rewrite, modernize, harmonize, condense, or adjust wording/punctuation.
  - No mixing translations (WEB only).
- Selective Bolding (locked):
  - Within Scripture text, apply <strong> ONLY to exact words/phrases listed in Annotations.
  - Nothing else is bolded.
  - Exact match only (no variants, no partials).

3) LINK RULES (LOCKED)
- Cross-References MUST link to WEB on eBible using:
  https://ebible.org/web/BOOK##.htm
- Prophecy Hub links MUST be internal and formatted exactly:
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/index.html#anchor">Theme Name</a>
- Do not invent external cross-reference sites.
- Do not invent Prophecy Hub anchors unless explicitly instructed.

4) FORMAT + TEMPLATE (LOCKED)
1) Output valid HTML5.
2) Use the LOCKED Revelation-1 style internal CSS/layout (cards/sections/nav/buttons).
   - No external CSS, no framework imports.
3) Must include top navigation and bottom navigation consistent with FPBible standard:
   - Bible Index + Book Index + Previous + Next links.

5) FILE + TITLE RULES (LOCKED)
- <title> and <h1> MUST match exactly:
  “{Book} {Chapter} — {Short Covenant-Themed Subtitle}”
- Prev/Next internal links MUST match repo naming scheme:
  - Do NOT invent folder names.
  - If unknown, follow the existing pattern for that book folder and remain consistent inside the output.

6) REQUIRED SECTION ORDER (LOCKED)
Each section MUST be separated by <hr />. No extra sections inserted.

1. Immediate Context
- One short paragraph: covenant-litigation / redemptive-historical scene-setting (no fluff).

2. Scripture (WEB)
- Full chapter text inside <div class="scripture-text">.
- Verse numbers wrapped in <span class="v-num">.
- Apply selective bolding ONLY per Annotations list.
- Include the eBible source URL for the chapter in a muted note directly under the Scripture heading (not inside Scripture text).

3. Fulfillment Notes (STRICT)
- EXACTLY 3–5 lines total.
- Each line = exactly one sentence.
- No quotes, no “maybe,” no mini-commentary.
- Must sharpen timing where relevant (“this generation,” “near,” “soon,” “at hand,” “in a little while,” etc.).
- OT chapters MUST state the covenant fulfillment trajectory (Christ → Cross → New Covenant → AD 70) without futurist drift.

4. Annotations
- Gray/soft box listing key terms with brief definitions (1–2 lines each).
- Include relevant covenant idioms for the chapter where applicable.
- The terms/phrases listed here define the ONLY phrases that receive <strong> in Scripture.
- No multi-paragraph essays.

5. Fulfillment Commentary (DEPTH REQUIRED)
- Minimum 700 words (900+ preferred for dense chapters).
- Break into numbered subheadings.
- Must connect imagery to covenant realities:
  Law / Temple / Priesthood / Sacrifice / Israel’s leadership / judgment-transfer / New Creation access.
- Must state the first-century resolution plainly (AD 70 context where applicable).
- Must NOT repeat Fulfillment Notes verbatim.
- Must explicitly reject futurist assumptions where commonly misread futuristically.
- Tone rule: explain calmly; do not spar or mock.

6. Prophecy Hub Links
- Bullet list of exactly 3 relevant internal themes (existing anchors only unless instructed).

7. Cross-References
- Bullet list of exactly 3 WEB links (OT/NT mix as appropriate).

8. New Creation Reality
- Short, grounded “now” meaning: presence, access, identity, Spirit-life.
- No fear-based application. No condemnation tone.

9. Reflection
- One challenging devotional question.
- Not moralistic. Not fear-based.

10. Footer (LOCKED)
- Prev/Next + Bible Index + Book Index links.
- Official Ko-fi button:
  https://ko-fi.com/B0B61QC1BU
- Extended WEB attribution note (as per site standard).

7) QUALITY CONTROL — HARD FAIL CONDITIONS (PASS/FAIL)
Hard fail if ANY of the following occur:
- Scripture text is not verifiably WEB from eBible.
- Any Scripture is paraphrased or edited.
- Any futurist “still pending” implication remains.
- Fulfillment Notes exceed 5 lines or fall below 3 lines.
- Any <strong> appears in Scripture that is not an exact Annotations phrase.
- Wrong number of Prophecy Hub links (must be exactly 3) or Cross-References (must be exactly 3).
- Missing required sections or wrong section order.
- Branding rule violated (any “Paraphrase Bible/Paraphrase” appears).

Task:
Generate the full HTML for: [BOOK NAME] [CHAPTER NUMBER].
Also include:
- Correct <title> and <h1> format:
  “{Book} {Chapter} — {Short Covenant-Themed Subtitle}”
- Correct internal Prev/Next file links consistent with the repo naming scheme.
