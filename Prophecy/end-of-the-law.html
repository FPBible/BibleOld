<h1>The End of the Law — Covenant Jurisdiction After Christ</h1>

<p class="small">
  This page exists to settle a question that controls how the entire Bible is read:
  <b>Are believers in Christ still under the jurisdiction of the Mosaic Law?</b>
  The FP Bible answer is direct and non-negotiable: <b>No.</b>
</p>

<p>
  “Not under law” does not mean “less serious faith,” “lower standards,” or “moral chaos.”
  It means a <b>change of covenant world</b>, a <b>change of legal authority</b>, and a <b>change of operating power</b> in the people of God.
</p>

<div class="note">
  Many systems say the Law is “fulfilled” but still functionally governing.
  Scripture says something stronger: <b>the Law’s covenant authority has ended</b>.
  If Sinai still rules, the cross did not actually change covenant jurisdiction.
</div>

<hr />

<div class="key">
  <h2>Core Thesis</h2>
  <p>
    The Mosaic Law was a <b>temporary covenant administration</b> given to Israel.
    It was tied to temple, priesthood, sacrifice, land, and national identity.
    It was never presented as an eternal moral constitution for the nations or the church.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Christ, that covenant reached its intended conclusion:
    the Law’s legal claims were removed
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:14</a>),
    its jurisdiction ended through covenant death
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom7.1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 7:1–6</a>),
    and believers now live under the administration and power of the Spirit
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>).
  </p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>What “Not Under Law” Actually Means</h2>

<h3>1) Jurisdiction Has Changed (Legal Authority)</h3>
<p>
  Paul’s statement “you are not under law but under grace”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:14</a>)
  is not a slogan. It is covenant-legal language.
  A law has authority only within its covenant domain. When that covenant ends, its authority ends with it.
</p>
<p>
  Paul proves this with courtroom logic:
  law has dominion only while the covenant subject lives.
  Through union with Christ’s death, believers have become “dead to the law” in order to belong to Another
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom7.1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 7:1–6</a>).
  That is a transfer of jurisdiction.
</p>

<div class="note">
  If you are “dead to the law,” you are not partially under it, not spiritually under it, and not under a “moral slice” of it.
  You are outside its covenant courtroom.
</div>

<h3>2) Condemnation Has Ended (Prosecution Power)</h3>
<p>
  The Law’s unique covenant power was not transformation. It was prosecution.
  Paul calls it “the ministry of death” and “the ministry of condemnation”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3.7-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3:7–9</a>).
</p>
<p>
  That is why “death” in Paul is not merely biological—it is covenantal: separation, accusation, exclusion, condemnation.
  In Christ, the prosecuting verdict is cancelled:
  “no condemnation”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom8.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8:1</a>).
</p>

<h3>3) Identity Has Changed (People Definition)</h3>
<p>
  Under Sinai, identity was maintained by boundary markers (circumcision, food laws, calendar observance, temple access).
  In Christ, identity is defined by union and new humanity.
  The dividing wall is removed and Jew/Gentile are made one
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Eph2.11-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephesians 2:11–22</a>).
</p>
<p>
  This is why Paul treats Law-return as rebuilding what Christ destroyed. It is not “depth.” It is regression.
</p>

<h3>4) Worship and Access Have Changed (Temple and Priesthood)</h3>
<p>
  The Law was inseparable from temple administration: priests, sacrifices, purity, calendar, and regulated access.
  Hebrews insists that Christ’s priesthood and offering are once-for-all, rendering the old system obsolete
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Heb7-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 7–10</a>).
</p>
<p>
  To place believers back under Sinai categories is to act as if Christ did not secure access and cleanse the conscience.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Walking by the Spirit Is Walking in Love (How Holiness Works Now)</h2>

<p>
  Paul’s contrast between <b>Law</b> and <b>Spirit</b> is not obedience vs disobedience.
  It is external covenant enforcement vs internal covenant life.
  The New Covenant does not produce holiness by threatening the flesh; it produces holiness by sharing life.
</p>

<p>
  “Walk by the Spirit” is not vague spirituality. Paul defines it:
  the fruit of the Spirit is love
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:22</a>).
  Love is not one option among many—it is the governing reality from which the rest flows.
</p>

<p>
  This is why Paul says:
  “He who loves another has fulfilled the Law”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom13.8-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 13:8–10</a>),
  and “all the Law is fulfilled in one word: you shall love your neighbor as yourself”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:14</a>).
</p>

<div class="note">
  Love does not <i>revive</i> Sinai. Love <i>fulfills</i> Sinai.
  Fulfillment means the Law’s intended outcome is reached and its jurisdiction is no longer needed.
  The Spirit produces what the Law demanded but could never generate
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.22-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:22–23</a>).
</div>

<p>
  This is why Paul’s logic is blunt:
  “If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:18</a>).
</p>

<div class="key">
  <h3>Practical Reframe (No Fog)</h3>
  <p class="small">
    “Not under law” means holiness is no longer produced by Sinai’s external code or sustained by fear of condemnation.
    Holiness is produced by shared life: union with Christ, led by the Spirit, expressed as love.
  </p>
  <div class="tight">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Law says:</b> “Do this to live.”</li>
      <li><b>Gospel says:</b> “Live, therefore walk.”</li>
      <li><b>Law pressures from outside.</b></li>
      <li><b>Spirit forms from within.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>AD 30–70: Overlap Period (Why the Letters Sound Like a Battle)</h2>

<p>
  The cross legally disarmed the Law, but the old covenant world still stood institutionally for a time.
  From AD 30 to AD 70, two covenant realities overlapped:
  the New Covenant was inaugurated, while the Old Covenant still existed publicly through temple administration.
</p>

<p>
  That is why apostolic writings contain sharp warnings about “returning,” “being bewitched,” “falling from grace,” and “turning back.”
  They were not writing into a peaceful theological debate.
  They were writing inside a live covenant collision where Torah-identity still claimed authority and demanded submission.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>AD 70: The Total End of the Law System (Objective, Historical Finality)</h2>

<p>
  AD 70 was the historical termination of the Mosaic covenant world’s public center.
  Jerusalem fell, the temple was destroyed, sacrifice ceased, priesthood ended, genealogical authority collapsed,
  and the covenant enforcement system lost its operating infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  This is not symbolic language. It is real-world annihilation of the Law system as an administration.
  You cannot “go back” to what was dismantled. You can only reenact it as a religious imitation.
</p>

<p>
  Hebrews describes the old covenant as obsolete and “near vanishing”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Heb8.13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 8:13</a>),
  fitting Jesus’ time-statements regarding that generation and the temple’s end
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Matt24.1-34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 24:1–34</a>).
</p>

<div class="note">
  The modern error is reading post-AD70 Christianity as if the AD 30–70 overlap still exists.
  That mistake turns transitional warnings into permanent structures and imports Sinai back into New Creation life.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>The Apostolic Battle (Then) vs the Religious Import (Now)</h2>

<p>
  Much of the New Testament records a battle: will the church be defined by <b>Christ</b> or by <b>Sinai</b>?
  That conflict dominates Galatians, Romans, Hebrews, Acts, and parts of Corinthians.
</p>

<p>
  The key point: the apostolic conflict was <b>transitional</b>, not timeless.
  It was written inside the AD 30–70 overlap when the old system still stood and demanded allegiance.
</p>

<p>
  Modern religion keeps replaying that battle because it reads the apostolic period without covenant-historical awareness.
  It treats the overlap as normal, reads the letters as if Sinai still has standing, and then builds Christian life on categories
  that belonged to a covenant world that has ended.
</p>

<p>
  Paul does not treat Law-return as harmless or optional. He treats it as regression:
  rebuilding the Law is falling from grace
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:1–4</a>).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What “Not Under Law” Does <em>Not</em> Mean (Objections Answered)</h2>

<h3>1) It Does Not Mean Moral Collapse</h3>
<p>
  Paul answers the objection directly:
  “Shall we sin because we are not under law?”
  “By no means”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:15</a>).
</p>

<p>
  The New Covenant does not remove holiness; it removes condemnation and replaces command-pressure with Spirit-life.
  The righteous requirement is fulfilled in those who walk according to the Spirit
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom8.1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8:1–4</a>).
</p>

<h3>2) It Does Not Mean God Changed</h3>
<p>
  God’s character did not change. Covenant administration did.
  The Law was a guardian until Christ; once faith has come, believers are no longer under that guardian
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal3.24-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 3:24–25</a>).
</p>

<h3>3) It Does Not Mean “Keep the Moral Law” as a Slice of Sinai</h3>
<p>
  Scripture treats the Law as a unified covenant package.
  “Whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Jas2.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James 2:10</a>).
</p>

<div class="note">
  The popular “moral/civil/ceremonial” division is a later theological strategy to preserve Sinai while discarding what cannot be kept.
  That grid is not how the apostles argue.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>Where Covenant Theology and Theonomy Go Wrong</h2>

<h3>1) They Redefine Fulfillment to Preserve Sinai</h3>
<p>
  Covenant theology often says the Law is “fulfilled” while still functioning as the Christian rule of life.
  That is not fulfillment; it is reinstallation.
  It turns the gospel into “forgiven so you can go back to law.”
</p>

<h3>2) They Keep Sinai as the Measuring Stick</h3>
<p>
  When Sinai becomes the baseline of Christian life, assurance is quietly tied to performance,
  and holiness becomes fear-driven maintenance rather than Spirit-produced fruit.
</p>

<h3>3) Theonomy Turns Sinai Into a Political Program</h3>
<p>
  Theonomy attempts to universalize Israel’s covenant charter and enforce it through modern states.
  Jesus rejects this: His kingdom is not from this world
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.John18.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 18:36</a>).
</p>

<div class="note">
  Bottom line: covenant theology preserves Sinai; theonomy enforces it.
  Both misunderstand the finality of the covenant transition and the New Creation operating reality.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality (Life Now, Not Law Now)</h2>

<p>
  In the New Creation, righteousness is not a demand hanging over you. It is a shared life in Christ.
  You are complete in Him
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:10</a>),
  led by the Spirit
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:18</a>),
  and free from the Law’s jurisdiction
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:14</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Love is not law-lite. Love is law transcended.
  “Against such things there is no law”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:23</a>)
  — not because standards were lowered, but because the Law has nothing left to prosecute where life reigns.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Where have you measured your standing with God by Sinai-based categories rather than union with Christ?</li>
  <li>What changes when holiness is treated as Spirit-produced love rather than law-driven pressure?</li>
  <li>Do your “shoulds” flow from life and love—or from fear of condemnation and religious performance?</li>
  <li>Which parts of your thinking are still stuck in the AD 30–70 overlap rather than the finished New Creation?</li>
</ul>
