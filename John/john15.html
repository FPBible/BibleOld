<h1>John 15</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
â€œI am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.<br/>
Every branch in me that doesnâ€™t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.<br/>
You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.<br/>
Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch canâ€™t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.<br/>
I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.<br/>
If a man doesnâ€™t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.<br/>
If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.<br/>
â€œIn this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.<br/>
Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.<br/>
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Fatherâ€™s commandments, and remain in his love.<br/>
I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.<br/>
â€œThis is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.<br/>
Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.<br/>
You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.<br/>
No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesnâ€™t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.<br/>
You didnâ€™t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.<br/>
â€œI command these things to you, that you may love one another.<br/>
If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.<br/>
If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.<br/>
Remember the word that I said to you: â€˜A servant is not greater than his lord.â€™ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.<br/>
But they will do all these things to you for my nameâ€™s sake, because they donâ€™t know him who sent me.<br/>
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<br/>
He who hates me, hates my Father also.<br/>
If I hadnâ€™t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldnâ€™t have had sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father.<br/>
But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, â€˜They hated me without a cause.â€™<br/>
â€œWhen the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.<br/>
You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The disciples during the final night before the crucifixion</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The true Israel is being defined as union with Christ, not descent from Abraham</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus identifies Himself as the fulfillment of Israelâ€™s vine imagery and redefines fruitfulness, belonging, and judgment.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) â€œI am the true vineâ€ replaces old Israel</h3>
<p>Israel was repeatedly called Godâ€™s vine, yet failed to produce fruit. Jesus now identifies Himself as the true vine, redefining covenant identity around union with Him rather than ethnicity or Law.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>National Israel as the covenant vine, Law-defined fruitfulness, and external markers of belonging.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>A living union with Christ producing fruit through shared life, not religious striving.</p>
<h3>4) Pruning is covenant transition, not punishment</h3>
<p>The pruning language reflects removal from the old system and refinement within the new. This is not about individual condemnation but covenant realignment.</p>
<h3>5) â€œThrown into the fireâ€</h3>
<p>This imagery points to covenant judgment on fruitless branches within Israel, culminating in the first-century judgment that removed the old vine structure.</p>
<h3>6) Friendship replaces servanthood</h3>
<p>Jesus elevates His disciples from servants under command to friends sharing knowledge and purpose. This reflects full covenant inclusion.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The true vine stands as Jerusalemâ€™s old vine is judged and removed. The fruit-bearing community continues beyond AD 70 as the New Creation people.</p>

<h2>Key Idioms &amp; Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vine / branches</strong> â€” covenant identity and shared life</li>
<li><strong>Fruit</strong> â€” visible expression of covenant life</li>
<li><strong>Pruning</strong> â€” covenant transition and refinement</li>
<li><strong>Fire</strong> â€” judgment on the old order</li>
<li><strong>World</strong> â€” the covenant system opposed to Christ</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>You do not strive to produce life â€” you remain in the Life that already flows. Fruit is not forced; it grows naturally from union with Christ.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Where might you be trying to produce fruit apart from simply remaining in Christ?</p>
