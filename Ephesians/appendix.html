<h2>Why This Appendix Exists</h2>

<p>
Ephesians is one of the clearest New Creation letters in the New Testament.
It is not written as a prediction of distant events.
It is written as a proclamation of a finished covenant transition
and the settled identity of God’s people in Christ.
</p>

<p>
This appendix exists to keep the letter readable and stable.
It defines the major phrases Paul uses
so the reader is not forced into futurist assumptions
or fear-based interpretations.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) “In Christ”</h2>

<p>
“In Christ” is not religious language for “trying to be a better person.”
It is covenant location.
It describes where life is now found:
in union with the risen and enthroned Messiah.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">Not:</span> self-improvement</li>
  <li><span class="k">But:</span> participation — shared life, access, identity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ephesians treats “in Christ” as present reality, not future reward.
If you read it as postponed, the entire letter collapses.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) “Heavenly Places”</h2>

<p>
“Heavenly places” does not mean “where you go when you die.”
It refers to present authority and access:
a shared position in Christ’s reign.
</p>

<p>
Paul’s focus is not geography.
It is status:
Christ is seated above every rule and power,
and His people share His position.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">Not:</span> a future map of the afterlife</li>
  <li><span class="k">But:</span> present covenant access and authority</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
Prophecy background:
<a href="/Bible/Prophecy/son-of-man.html">Son of Man authority (Daniel 7)</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) “Dead” and “Alive”</h2>

<p>
In Ephesians 2, “dead” is not physical death.
It is covenant death:
life under sin and condemnation,
shaped by an age that was passing away.
</p>

<p>
“Alive” is covenant resurrection:
life in Christ, in the Spirit,
with access to the Father.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">Dead:</span> alienated, condemned, outside covenant life</li>
  <li><span class="k">Alive:</span> reconciled, included, sharing Christ’s life</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
Resurrection framework:
<a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">Resurrection Explained — 1 Corinthians 15</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) “The Mystery”</h2>

<p>
A biblical “mystery” is not something still waiting to happen.
It is something once hidden that is now revealed.
Paul says it plainly:
the mystery “has now been revealed.”
</p>

<p>
The mystery is not a secret rapture.
It is the creation of one new covenant people:
Gentiles included as fellow heirs,
members of the same body,
without Torah boundary markers.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">Not:</span> future prophecy code</li>
  <li><span class="k">But:</span> the now-revealed New Humanity in Christ</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>5) “Ages” and Time Language</h2>

<p>
Ephesians is saturated with time markers:
“formerly… but now,”
“now revealed,”
“ages,”
“the day,”
“until.”
</p>

<p>
These markers refer to a real covenant transition
that occurred within the first century:
the old covenant order reached its end,
and the New Covenant world was established in Christ.
</p>

<p>
This does not require charts.
It requires honesty about Paul’s tense
and the New Testament’s own time-bound language.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) “Rulers, Authorities, Powers”</h2>

<p>
Ephesians speaks of rulers and powers
because the old covenant world operated through authority structures
that enforced separation, accusation, and condemnation.
</p>

<p>
Paul does not tell believers to chase spirits.
He tells them to stand firm in truth, righteousness, peace, and faith.
The conflict is allegiance and stability,
not supernatural combat theatre.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">Not:</span> demon-hunting instructions</li>
  <li><span class="k">But:</span> standing against accusation and oppressive authority</li>
</ul>

</p>

<hr />

<h2>7) “The Law” and “The Dividing Wall”</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 2 states the dividing wall was abolished:
the “law of commandments expressed in ordinances.”
This is not poetic.
It is decisive.
</p>

<p>
The Law functioned as a covenant boundary system.
Its removal is the basis of peace
and the creation of one new humanity.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">What ended:</span> Torah as covenant boundary and condemning power</li>
  <li><span class="k">What remains:</span> life in the Spirit expressed through love</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ephesians does not reintroduce the Law in chapters 4–6.
It describes what love looks like in a reconciled people.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8) “Temple” and “Dwelling Place”</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 2 calls believers a temple and a dwelling place of God.
This is the New Covenant replacement of the old temple system.
</p>

<p>
God’s presence is no longer housed in stone and priesthood.
It is present in a people.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">Not:</span> future rebuilding</li>
  <li><span class="k">But:</span> present indwelling by the Spirit</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>9) “Submission” and Household Instructions</h2>

<p>
Paul addresses real first-century social structures
without endorsing domination.
His ethic is shaped by Christ:
self-giving love, service, and non-partiality.
</p>

<p>
The controlling principle is mutual submission:
“submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.”
</p>

<p>
Ephesians uses household relationships
as practical ground for New Creation life:
truth, kindness, restraint, love, and dignity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>10) What Ephesians Is Actually Doing</h2>

<p>
Ephesians is not trying to motivate believers through fear.
It is not trying to keep them waiting for what God might do one day.
</p>

<p>
It is announcing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="k">a finished reconciliation</span> (one body, one Spirit, one access)</li>
  <li><span class="k">a settled identity</span> (in Christ, chosen, adopted, sealed)</li>
  <li><span class="k">a present authority</span> (seated with Christ, standing firm)</li>
  <li><span class="k">a visible way of life</span> (truth, love, peace, maturity)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ephesians only reads cleanly when you stop postponing it.
It is New Creation reality, written as now.
</p>
