      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Jesus has just pronounced the house “left desolate” (Matt 23) and now interprets the coming temple collapse as covenant judgment,
        answering the disciples’ question about “these things” and “the end of the age” within their first-century horizon.

      <h2>2. Scripture (WEB)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Source (must match verbatim): https://ebible.org/web/MAT24.htm</p>

      <div class="scripture-text">
  <span class="v-num">1</span>
  Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.<br />

  <span class="v-num">2</span>
  But he answered them, “You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here <strong>one stone on another</strong>, that will not be thrown down.”<br />

  <span class="v-num">3</span>
  As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of <strong>the end of the age</strong>?”<br />

  <span class="v-num">4</span>
  Jesus answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.<br />

  <span class="v-num">5</span>
  For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray.<br />

  <span class="v-num">6</span>
  You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren’t troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.<br />

  <span class="v-num">7</span>
  For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.<br />

  <span class="v-num">8</span>
  But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.<br />    
    <span class="v-num">11</span>
  Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray.<br />

  <span class="v-num">12</span>
  Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.<br />

  <span class="v-num">13</span>
  But he who endures to the end will be saved.<br />

  <span class="v-num">14</span>
  This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.<br />

  <span class="v-num">15</span>
  “When, therefore, you see the <strong>abomination of desolation</strong>,* which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),<br />

  <span class="v-num">16</span>
  then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.<br />

  <span class="v-num">17</span>
  Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house.<br />

  <span class="v-num">18</span>
  Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.<br />

  <span class="v-num">19</span>
  But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!<br />

  <span class="v-num">20</span>
  Pray that your flight will not be in the winter nor on a Sabbath,<br />

  <span class="v-num">21</span>
  for then there will be great suffering,† such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.<br />

  <span class="v-num">22</span>
  Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.<br />

  <span class="v-num">23</span>
  “Then if any man tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘There!’ don’t believe it.<br />

  <span class="v-num">24</span>
  For false christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.<br />

  <span class="v-num">25</span>
  “Behold, I have told you beforehand.<br />

  <span class="v-num">26</span>
  “If therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ don’t go out; or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ don’t believe it.<br />

  <span class="v-num">27</span>
  For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br />

  <span class="v-num">28</span>
  For wherever the carcass is, that is where the vultures‡ gather together.<br />

  <span class="v-num">29</span>
  “But immediately after the suffering§ of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;*<br />

  <span class="v-num">30</span>
  and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man <strong>coming on the clouds</strong> of the sky with power and great glory.<br />

  <span class="v-num">31</span>
  He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.<br />

  <span class="v-num">32</span>
  “Now from the fig tree learn this parable: When its branch has now become tender and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near.<br />

  <span class="v-num">33</span>
  Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that he is near, even at the doors.<br />

  <span class="v-num">34</span>
  Most certainly I tell you, <strong>this generation</strong>† will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.<br />

  <span class="v-num">35</span>
  <strong>Heaven and earth</strong> will pass away, but my words will not pass away.<br />

  <span class="v-num">36</span>
  “But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven,‡ but my Father only.<br />

  <span class="v-num">37</span>
  As the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br />

  <span class="v-num">38</span>
  For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,<br />

  <span class="v-num">39</span>
  and they didn’t know until the flood came and took them all away, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br />

  <span class="v-num">40</span>
  Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left.<br />

  <span class="v-num">41</span>
  Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and one will be left.<br />

  <span class="v-num">42</span>
  Watch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes.<br />

  <span class="v-num">43</span>
  But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.<br />

  <span class="v-num">44</span>
  Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come.<br />

  <span class="v-num">45</span>
  “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?<br />

  <span class="v-num">46</span>
  Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.<br />

  <span class="v-num">47</span>
  Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.<br />

  <span class="v-num">48</span>
  But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’<br />

  <span class="v-num">49</span>
  and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,<br />

  <span class="v-num">50</span>
  the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn’t expect it and in an hour when he doesn’t know it,<br />

  <span class="v-num">51</span>
  and will cut him in pieces and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.<br />

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Question Is About the Temple and “These Things”</h3>
      <p>
        Matthew 24 begins with an unmistakable concrete referent: the temple. Jesus has just announced covenant exposure and judgment on
        Jerusalem’s leadership (Matt 23), and as he leaves the temple the disciples point out its buildings. Jesus responds with a total
        demolition forecast—“not be left here one stone on another.” That line is not a mood, a metaphor, or a vague spiritual principle.
        It is covenant-judgment speech attached to a real building in their real city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disciples’ follow-up question has two parts that belong together in their minds: “When will these things be?” (the temple
        judgment) and “what is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?” The lock point is the phrase “end of the age,” which
        in covenant categories means the closing of the Mosaic administration, not the termination of the created order. If “age” is the
        covenant world of Torah-temple-priesthood, then “end” is the transition into the New Covenant order established in Christ and
        publicly vindicated in the first-century crisis culminating in AD 70.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Birth Pains, False Christs, and the Covenant Pressure Cooker</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus lists wars, rumors, upheavals, and distress as “the beginning of birth pains.” In prophetic-covenant terms, birth pains are
        not random history; they are the pressure signals of an order about to give way to another. The old covenant house is being brought
        to account, and the new covenant reality is emerging. This is why Jesus repeatedly commands sobriety: “don’t be troubled,” “don’t be
        led astray,” “I have told you beforehand.” The aim is not to feed speculation but to keep first-century disciples anchored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persecution language also fits the immediate apostolic horizon: “they will deliver you up… you will be hated… many will stumble.”
        The church’s early decades were marked by covenant conflict—synagogue expulsion, accusations, and pressure from both Judean and Roman
        authorities. Matthew is not writing a generic tribulation template; he is recording Jesus’ covenant lawsuit warning and shepherding
        counsel for the generation standing at the threshold of the transition.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Abomination and the Local Flight Command</h3>
      <p>
        The “abomination of desolation” is the pivot point that triggers a very specific instruction: “then let those who are in Judea flee
        to the mountains.” This is geography. It is calendar-aware (“pray that your flight will not be… on a Sabbath”). It assumes local
        travel realities (“roof,” “field,” “cloak”). These details are not compatible with a global end-of-the-world scenario. They are
        compatible with a covenant-judgment event that strikes Judea and Jerusalem in the first century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel’s abomination imagery is covenantal: profanation, usurpation, and the climax of covenant-breaking reaching its terminal
        judgment. Jesus signals that when that marker becomes visible, disciples are not to debate; they are to flee. This is the difference
        between futurist sensationalism and covenant reading: one turns the text into distant speculation; the other treats it as the living
        instruction it was for that audience.
      </p>

      <h3>4) “Coming” as Vindication: Clouds, Tribes, and Prophetic De-Creation</h3>
      <p>
        The most contested lines involve cosmic imagery and “coming on the clouds.” In the Hebrew prophetic register, sun/moon/stars language
        regularly depicts the collapse of rulers and covenant order—de-creation imagery for regime change and judgment, not a literal
        astronomy forecast. Matthew’s language is saturated with that register.
      </p>
      <p>
        “They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds” evokes Daniel’s court imagery where the Son of Man is vindicated and given
        authority. In covenant terms, this is Jesus’ public vindication: the rejected Messiah is shown to be enthroned, and the old covenant
        persecuting system is judged. “All the tribes of the earth will mourn” reads naturally as the tribes of the land (Israel) mourning
        as judgment arrives—again covenant-local, not global-dispersed.
      </p>

      <h3>5) The Time-Lock: “This Generation” and the Passing of Heaven and Earth</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus then locks interpretation with one of the strongest time markers in the Gospels: “Most certainly I tell you, this generation
        will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.” Whatever interpretive gymnastics a reader attempts, this line is the
        governor. It forbids pushing fulfillment thousands of years away while pretending to honor the text. Under the locked The Fulfilled Prophecy Bible lens,
        “this generation” means the living audience Jesus addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away” is covenant weight language: the old covenant world (its temple
        center, priesthood, and accusatory administration) is shakable and passing, but Christ’s word stands. This is not the annihilation of
        the cosmos; it is the irreversible triumph of the New Covenant reality over the fading Mosaic order.
      </p>

      <h3>6) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        This chapter is not teaching a future end-of-planet event; it is covenant litigation attached to the temple and bound by “this
        generation.” It is not a rapture chart; it is discipleship instruction for a real first-century crisis. It is not literal sky-travel
        language; it uses the prophetic idiom of clouds to speak of judgment and vindication. It is not fear-based speculation; it is
        shepherding clarity for those who needed to endure faithfully through the transition.
      </p>

      <h3>7) The New Covenant Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        The resolution is plain: the old temple order collapses, the covenant lawsuit reaches its historical climax, and Christ’s kingship is
        publicly vindicated in the transition culminating in AD 70. The Kingdom is not waiting; it is present. Access is not postponed; it is
        open. The “end” is not the end of creation; it is the end of the Mosaic age, making way for the settled New Creation life in the
        Spirit.
