<h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
<h2>Chapter 21 — Restoration, Vocation, and the Life That Follows</h2>

<h3>Jesus Appears by the Sea</h3>

<p>
  After this Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples
  by the Sea of Tiberias,
  and He revealed Himself in this way.
  Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin,
  Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,
  the sons of Zebedee,
  and two others of His disciples were together.
  Simon Peter said to them,
  “I am going fishing.”
  They said to him,
  “We will go with you.”
  They went out and got into the boat,
  but that night they caught nothing
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:1–3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Just as day was breaking,
  Jesus stood on the shore;
  yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
  Jesus said to them,
  “Children, do you have any fish?”
  They answered Him,
  “No.”
  He said to them,
  “Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
  and you will find some.”
  So they cast it,
  and now they were not able to haul it in,
  because of the quantity of fish
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:4–6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter,
  “It is the Lord!”
  When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
  he put on his outer garment,
  for he was stripped for work,
  and threw himself into the sea.
  The other disciples came in the boat,
  dragging the net full of fish,
  for they were not far from the land,
  about a hundred yards off
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:7–8)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Breakfast With the Risen Lord</h3>

<p>
  When they got out on land,
  they saw a charcoal fire in place,
  with fish laid out on it, and bread.
  Jesus said to them,
  “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”
  So Simon Peter went aboard
  and hauled the net ashore,
  full of large fish, 153 of them.
  And although there were so many,
  the net was not torn.
  Jesus said to them,
  “Come and have breakfast.”
  Now none of the disciples dared ask Him,
  “Who are You?”
  They knew it was the Lord
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:9–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them,
  and so with the fish.
  This was now the third time
  that Jesus was revealed to the disciples
  after He was raised from the dead
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:13–14)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Peter Restored</h3>

<p>
  When they had finished breakfast,
  Jesus said to Simon Peter,
  “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?”
  He said to Him,
  “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”
  He said to him,
  “Feed My lambs.”
  He said to him a second time,
  “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”
  He said to Him,
  “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”
  He said to him,
  “Tend My sheep.”
  He said to him the third time,
  “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”
  Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
  “Do you love Me?”
  And he said to Him,
  “Lord, You know everything;
  You know that I love You.”
  Jesus said to him,
  “Feed My sheep”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:15–17)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Follow Me</h3>

<p>
  Jesus said,
  “Truly, truly, I say to you,
  when you were young,
  you used to dress yourself
  and walk wherever you wanted,
  but when you are old,
  you will stretch out your hands,
  and another will dress you
  and carry you where you do not want to go.”
  This He said to show
  by what kind of death
  Peter was to glorify God.
  And after saying this He said to him,
  “Follow Me”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:18–19)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them,
  the one who also had leaned back against Him during the supper
  and had said,
  “Lord, who is it that is going to betray You?”
  When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus,
  “Lord, what about this man?”
  Jesus said to him,
  “If it is My will that he remain until I come,
  what is that to you?
  You follow Me!”
  So the saying spread abroad among the brothers
  that this disciple was not to die;
  yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die,
  but,
  “If it is My will that he remain until I come,
  what is that to you?”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:20–23)</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Testimony Completed</h3>

<p>
  This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things,
  and who has written these things,
  and we know that his testimony is true.
  Now there are also many other things that Jesus did.
  Were every one of them to be written,
  I suppose that the world itself
  could not contain the books that would be written
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:24–25)</a>.

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 21</h2>

<h3>1. Resurrection meets ordinary life</h3>
<p>
  The risen Jesus appears not in a temple or throne room,
  but on a shoreline at daybreak.
  New Creation life is lived in ordinary places,
  not withdrawn from them.
</p>

<h3>2. Fruitfulness follows recognition</h3>
<p>
  The nets fill only after the disciples recognise the Lord.
  In the New Creation,
  fruit flows from relationship,
  not effort alone.
</p>

<h3>3. Restoration is vocational, not merely emotional</h3>
<p>
  Jesus restores Peter by entrusting him with responsibility.
  Grace does not merely remove guilt;
  it renews calling.
</p>

<h3>4. Love expresses itself in care for others</h3>
<p>
  “Do you love Me?” is answered by “Feed My sheep.”
  Love for Christ takes shape as participation in His care.
</p>

<h3>5. Following Jesus is personal</h3>
<p>
  Comparison is excluded.
  Each disciple follows Christ within their own path.
</p>

<h3>6. “Until I come” is not a calendar puzzle</h3>
<p>
  Jesus speaks within the disciples’ horizon.
  John closes without turning the Gospel into speculation.
</p>

<h3>7. The Gospel ends open-ended</h3>
<p>
  John does not attempt to exhaust the story.
  The risen Christ continues to act,
  and New Creation life continues forward.
</p>

<p>
  John ends not with closure,
  but with invitation —
  restored people,
  renewed purpose,
  and life lived in the presence of the risen Lord.
</p>
