<h1>Romans 6</h1>
<h2>Released from Sin’s Mastery</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — United with Christ in Death and Life (Romans 6:1–11)</h2>

<p><strong>6:1–2</strong> What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may increase? Absolutely not. How can we who died to sin still live in it?</p>

<p><strong>6:3–4</strong> Do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? We were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p>

<p><strong>6:5–7</strong> For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection. We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For the one who has died has been released from sin.</p>

<p><strong>6:8–11</strong> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again — death no longer has dominion over Him. The death He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life He lives, He lives to God. So you too must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — From Slavery to Freedom (Romans 6:12–23)</h2>

<p><strong>6:12–14</strong> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its desires. Do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness. For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under Law but under grace.</p>

<p><strong>6:15–18</strong> What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law but under grace? Absolutely not. Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey — either of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you were slaves of sin, you obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted, and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>6:19–23</strong> I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness leading to lawlessness, so now present them as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness. For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness. But what fruit were you getting then from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to God, the fruit you get leads to holiness, and the outcome is life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 6 answers the misunderstanding created by grace.
If grace overflows where sin increased (Romans 5), does sin now become acceptable?
Paul’s response is emphatic: grace does not excuse sin — it breaks its power.
</p>

<p>
This chapter explains how the new covenant changes mastery.
The issue is no longer condemnation, but allegiance.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) “Died to sin” is a covenant shift, not sinless perfection</h3>
<p>
Paul is not claiming believers never fail.
He is declaring a change of jurisdiction.
Sin no longer rules as a master.
The old covenant world where sin reigned through Law has ended.
</p>

<h3>2) Baptism marks participation, not ritual magic</h3>
<p>
Baptism identifies believers with Christ’s death and resurrection.
It signifies transfer of identity and allegiance.
This is covenant participation language, not a mechanical act.
</p>

<h3>3) Resurrection life is present, not postponed</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say believers will one day walk in newness of life.
He says they <em>do</em>.
Resurrection life defines the present New Creation existence.
</p>

<h3>4) “Not under Law but under grace” names the new authority</h3>
<p>
This phrase is decisive.
Law no longer governs the covenant people.
Grace now defines the relationship.
That is why sin’s mastery is broken.
</p>

<h3>5) Slavery language explains allegiance, not fear</h3>
<p>
Paul uses slavery imagery to describe control.
Everyone serves something.
The question is not whether you serve —
but what kind of master governs your life.
Grace produces willing obedience, not coerced compliance.
</p>

<h3>6) “Wages” vs “gift” contrasts systems</h3>
<p>
Sin operates on earned outcomes — death follows participation.
God operates on gift — life is granted, not achieved.
Paul is contrasting covenant systems, not threatening believers.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 6 reframes obedience.
You do not obey to avoid punishment.
You obey because your master has changed.
Grace reshapes desire rather than enforcing behaviour.
</p>

<p>
You are not trying to die to sin.
You live from the fact that you already have.
That is freedom.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be negotiating with sin as if it had authority —
and what would change if I lived fully from grace as my governing reality?
</p>
