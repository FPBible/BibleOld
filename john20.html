<h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
<h2>Chapter 20 — New Creation Morning and the Breath of Life</h2>

<h3>The Empty Tomb</h3>

<p>
  Now on the first day of the week,
  Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early,
  while it was still dark,
  and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
  So she ran and went to Simon Peter
  and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved,
  and said to them,
  “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,
  and we do not know where they have laid Him”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:1–2)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  So Peter went out with the other disciple,
  and they were going toward the tomb.
  Both of them were running together,
  but the other disciple outran Peter
  and reached the tomb first.
  And stooping to look in,
  he saw the linen cloths lying there,
  but he did not go in.
  Then Simon Peter came,
  following him,
  and went into the tomb.
  He saw the linen cloths lying there,
  and the face cloth,
  which had been on Jesus’ head,
  not lying with the linen cloths
  but folded up in a place by itself.
  Then the other disciple,
  who had reached the tomb first,
  also went in,
  and he saw and believed;
  for as yet they did not understand the Scripture,
  that He must rise from the dead
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:3–9)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</h3>

<p>
  But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb,
  and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.
  She saw two angels in white,
  sitting where the body of Jesus had lain,
  one at the head and one at the feet.
  They said to her,
  “Woman, why are you weeping?”
  She said,
  “They have taken away my Lord,
  and I do not know where they have laid Him.”
  Having said this,
  she turned around and saw Jesus standing,
  but she did not know that it was Jesus.
  Jesus said to her,
  “Woman, why are you weeping?
  Whom are you seeking?”
  Supposing Him to be the gardener,
  she said,
  “Sir, if You have carried Him away,
  tell me where You have laid Him,
  and I will take Him away.”
  Jesus said to her,
  “Mary.”
  She turned and said to Him in Aramaic,
  “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher)
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:11–16)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Jesus said to her,
  “Do not cling to Me,
  for I have not yet ascended to the Father;
  but go to My brothers and say to them,
  ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father,
  to My God and your God.’”
  Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples,
  “I have seen the Lord,”
  and that He had said these things to her
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:17–18)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Peace and the Breath of Life</h3>

<p>
  On the evening of that day,
  the first day of the week,
  the doors being locked
  where the disciples were
  for fear of the Jews,
  Jesus came and stood among them and said,
  “Peace be with you.”
  When He had said this,
  He showed them His hands and His side.
  Then the disciples were glad
  when they saw the Lord.
  Jesus said to them again,
  “Peace be with you.
  As the Father has sent Me,
  even so I am sending you.”
  And when He had said this,
  He breathed on them and said,
  “Receive the Holy Spirit”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:19–22)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  “If you forgive the sins of any,
  they are forgiven them;
  if you withhold forgiveness from any,
  it is withheld”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:23)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Thomas Sees and Believes</h3>

<p>
  Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin,
  was not with them when Jesus came.
  So the other disciples told him,
  “We have seen the Lord.”
  But he said,
  “Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails,
  and place my finger into the mark of the nails,
  and place my hand into His side,
  I will never believe.”
  Eight days later,
  His disciples were inside again,
  and Thomas was with them.
  Although the doors were locked,
  Jesus came and stood among them and said,
  “Peace be with you.”
  Then He said to Thomas,
  “Put your finger here, and see My hands;
  and put out your hand, and place it in My side.
  Do not disbelieve, but believe.”
  Thomas answered Him,
  “My Lord and my God!”
  Jesus said to him,
  “Have you believed because you have seen Me?
  Blessed are those who have not seen
  and yet have believed”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:24–29)</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Purpose of the Gospel</h3>

<p>
  Now Jesus did many other signs
  in the presence of the disciples,
  which are not written in this book;
  but these are written
  so that you may believe
  that Jesus is the Christ,
  the Son of God,
  and that by believing
  you may have life in His name
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN20.htm#v30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 20:30–31)</a>.

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 20</h2>

<h3>1. Resurrection begins a new creation week</h3>
<p>
  John deliberately marks “the first day of the week.”
  This is creation language.
  Resurrection is not merely proof of survival,
  but the inauguration of a new order of life.
</p>

<h3>2. The gardener is not a mistake</h3>
<p>
  Mary’s assumption is narratively loaded.
  New Creation begins in a garden again.
</p>

<h3>3. “Do not cling to Me” signals a new mode of presence</h3>
<p>
  Relationship with Jesus is no longer based on physical proximity,
  but on shared life through the Spirit.
</p>

<h3>4. Jesus breathes — Genesis is echoed</h3>
<p>
  The breath of Jesus signals the giving of new creation life,
  not as a preview,
  but as a real impartation.
</p>

<h3>5. Forgiveness authority is covenantal</h3>
<p>
  This authority belongs to the proclamation of the finished work,
  not to individual control over souls.
</p>

<h3>6. Thomas’ confession is the Gospel’s climax</h3>
<p>
  “My Lord and my God” names the risen Jesus for who He is.
</p>

<h3>7. Life is the stated goal</h3>
<p>
  John writes so readers may have life now in the Son.
</p>

<p>
  John 20 marks the turning of the age:
  fear gives way to peace,
  the Spirit is breathed,
  and New Creation life stands present and active.
