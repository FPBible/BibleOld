<h1>Coming on the Clouds</h1>
<h2>Prophetic Theophany Language · Royal Presence · Covenant Vindication</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Reading Frame</strong><br />
  “Coming on the clouds” is not modern travel language.
  In Scripture it is prophetic theophany language: God “coming” in judgment and royal authority through historical events,
  so that His verdict is publicly displayed and His rule is unmistakable.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>1) What “Cloud Coming” Means in the Old Testament</h2>
<p>
In the prophets, Yahweh “comes” when He acts as Judge and King.
The language is not about God physically riding weather; it is about God’s authority breaking into history with covenant consequences.
Cloud imagery often carries themes of majesty, concealment, overwhelming presence, and judicial arrival.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Yahweh “comes” against nations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Egypt</strong>: “Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt.” (<a href="https://ebible.org/web/ISA19.htm">Isaiah 19 (WEB)</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Day-of-the-LORD clouds</strong>: “It will be a day of clouds, a time of doom…” (<a href="https://ebible.org/web/EZK30.htm">Ezekiel 30 (WEB)</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Darkness / cloud judgement imagery</strong>: covenant-wrath vocabulary in the prophets (e.g., <a href="https://ebible.org/web/ZEP01.htm">Zephaniah 1 (WEB)</a>)</li>
</ul>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Control Point</strong><br />
  In the prophets, “cloud coming” = divine action in judgment and rule (historically expressed),
  not literal meteorological transport.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>2) Daniel 7 Is the Key (Direction Matters)</h2>
<p>
Daniel 7:13–14 is the core “cloud” passage behind Jesus’ claim.
Notice what happens in the vision:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>One like a son of man comes <strong>with the clouds</strong></li>
  <li>He comes <strong>to</strong> the Ancient of Days</li>
  <li>He receives dominion, glory, and a kingdom</li>
</ul>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Direction Matters</strong><br />
  Daniel 7 is a royal approach and enthronement scene: the Son of Man comes into authority and receives the kingdom.
  This is not “Jesus coming down to earth”; it is Jesus being publicly vindicated and installed as King.
</div>

<p>
That’s why “coming on the clouds” naturally functions as <strong>vindication language</strong>:
the one condemned by the old order is shown to be the enthroned Judge of that order.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Jesus Applies Cloud-Coming to a Near, First-Century Horizon</h2>
<p>
In the Gospels, cloud-coming appears in tightly time-bound and temple-bound contexts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Temple judgment context</strong> (Matthew 23–24; Luke 21)</li>
  <li><strong>Local flight instructions</strong> (Judea, housetop, Sabbath, winter)</li>
  <li><strong>The time-lock</strong>: “this generation” (Matthew 24)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1 The high priest confrontation is explicit</h3>
<p>
Jesus tells the high priest:
</p>
<div class="frame">
  <strong>Matthew 26:64 control</strong><br />
  “From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”<br />
  (<a href="https://ebible.org/web/MAT26.htm">Matthew 26 (WEB)</a>)
</div>

<p>
That statement is aimed at the leadership judging Him in that moment.
It is Daniel 7 applied directly to them: their verdict against Jesus will be overturned by history—publicly.
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Non-negotiable</strong><br />
  If “coming on the clouds” is detached from temple judgment, “this generation,” and the Sanhedrin confrontation,
  it is being read out of its covenant context.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>4) “Seeing” in Prophetic Language</h2>
<p>
“Seeing” in the prophets often means recognising by outcome: events make the verdict obvious.
It is not always “eyeballs watching a spectacle in the sky.”
</p>
<p>
In covenant judgment settings, “you will see” means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>you will be forced to acknowledge who was right</li>
  <li>you will witness the collapse of the old claim to authority</li>
  <li>you will face the public reversal of the verdict against Jesus</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>5) Revelation 1:7 — “Every Eye” and “Those Who Pierced Him”</h2>
<p>
Revelation 1:7 brings together Daniel 7 cloud language with covenant mourning language:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Behold, he comes with the clouds…”</li>
  <li>“every eye will see him, including those who pierced him”</li>
  <li>“all the tribes of the earth will mourn…”</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">
Key point: the phrase “including those who pierced him” anchors the referent to the first-century covenant world that rejected Jesus.
</p>

<h3>5.1 “Those who pierced” is a covenant-local anchor</h3>
<p>
The leadership and covenant order that condemned Jesus are not a random future audience.
Revelation’s opening frames the book as “soon” and “near” for its original recipients,
and then immediately ties the cloud-coming to “those who pierced him.”
</p>

<h3>5.2 “Tribes” language fits Israel’s covenant vocabulary</h3>
<p>
“Tribes” is Israel vocabulary.
When Revelation and Matthew use “tribes” in judgment-mourning contexts,
it naturally reads as the tribes of the covenant land in lament as covenant judgment arrives.
This keeps the language coherent with the Gospels’ temple-judgment horizon.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) Matthew 24 / Luke 21 — Cloud Coming + Apocalyptic Imagery</h2>
<p>
Matthew 24 and Luke 21 describe Jerusalem’s judgment using:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>apocalyptic imagery (sun, moon, stars; powers shaken)</li>
  <li>cloud-coming language (royal vindication and judgment)</li>
  <li>time statements (especially “this generation”)</li>
</ul>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Prophetic Pattern</strong><br />
  This is exactly how the prophets describe covenant and national collapse: de-creation imagery for regime change and judgment,
  not modern astronomy predictions.
</div>

<p>
Under the The Fulfilled Prophecy Bible covenant lens, the “cloud coming” in these chapters is Christ’s royal vindication displayed through covenant judgment,
culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple (AD 70) as the public end of the old order’s claim to authority.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7) What This Is NOT</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not a prediction of Jesus physically surfing clouds as a “travel method.”</li>
  <li>Not a modern geopolitics forecast tool.</li>
  <li>Not a permission slip for fear-based end-times speculation.</li>
  <li>Not separable from “this generation” and temple judgment in the Gospels.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>8) New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
If Christ has been vindicated and enthroned, Christian life is not “waiting for Jesus to start reigning.”
It is living from His reign now:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>His authority is established</li>
  <li>the old covenant claim to access has ended</li>
  <li>His presence is shared by the Spirit</li>
  <li>the kingdom is received, not pending</li>
</ul>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
  “Coming on the clouds” = Jesus’ Daniel 7 kingship and covenant vindication, expressed through real historical judgment,
  not a postponed end-of-the-world event.
</div>
