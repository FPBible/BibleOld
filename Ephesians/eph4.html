<h1>Ephesians 4</h1>
<h2>Walk Worthy · One Body · Mature New Humanity</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm" target="_blank">
Ephesians 4 — WEB
</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Chapters 1–3 declared what God has already accomplished in Christ:
a new people, full access, shared life, and settled authority.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 4 begins with “therefore.”
This is not a return to Law or moralism.
It is the New Creation life being lived out visibly:
unity, maturity, truth, and love in one body.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Live From Your Calling (4:1–6)</h3>

<p>
Therefore, I urge you — as a prisoner in the Lord —
to walk in a way that matches the calling you have received:
</p>

<p>
with all humility and gentleness,
with patience,
bearing with one another in love,
</p>

<p>
being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit
in the bond of peace.
</p>

<p>
There is one body and one Spirit,
just as you were called in one hope of your calling;
</p>

<p>
one Lord,
one faith,
one baptism;
</p>

<p>
one God and Father of all,
who is over all and through all and in all.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Grace Given for Building the Body (4:7–13)</h3>

<p>
But grace was given to each one of us
according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it says:
“When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive,
and He gave gifts to people.”
</p>

<p>
Now what does “He ascended” mean
except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
</p>

<p>
The One who descended is also the One who ascended
far above all the heavens,
so that He might fill all things.
</p>

<p>
And He gave some as apostles,
some as prophets,
some as evangelists,
some as shepherds and teachers,
</p>

<p>
to equip the saints for the work of service,
for building up the body of Christ,
</p>

<p>
until we all arrive at the unity of the faith
and the full knowledge of the Son of God —
to mature humanity,
to the measure of the full stature of Christ.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The “until” here describes the first-century maturing of the new covenant body
from infancy (transition period) into stable unity.
It is not an open-ended delay of Christ’s work.
The body has been established; maturity is the intended outcome.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Maturity Replaces Instability (4:14–16)</h3>

<p>
Then we are no longer children,
tossed around by waves
and carried about by every wind of teaching,
by human trickery and craftiness.
</p>

<p>
Instead, speaking the truth in love,
we grow up in every way into Him
who is the head — Christ.
</p>

<p>
From Him the whole body,
joined and held together by every supporting ligament,
grows and builds itself up in love,
as each part does its work.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Put Off the Old Humanity (4:17–24)</h3>

<p>
So I say this and insist in the Lord:
you must no longer walk
as the nations walk,
in the futility of their thinking,
</p>

<p>
darkened in understanding,
alienated from the life of God
because of ignorance and hardness of heart.
</p>

<p>
Having become callous,
they gave themselves to sensuality
and every kind of impurity with greed.
</p>

<p>
But you did not learn Christ like that —
</p>

<p>
if indeed you heard Him
and were taught in Him,
as the truth is in Jesus:
</p>

<p>
to put off your former way of life,
the old humanity,
which was being corrupted by deceitful desires,
</p>

<p>
to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
</p>

<p>
and to put on the new humanity,
created according to God
in true righteousness and holiness.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Old humanity” is not “your old personality.”
It is the Adamic, Law-shaped existence marked by division, accusation, and death.
“New humanity” is the Christ-shaped people formed in the New Covenant.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>What New Humanity Looks Like (4:25–32)</h3>

<p>
Therefore, having put away falsehood,
each of you speak truth with your neighbour,
because we are members of one another.
</p>

<p>
Be angry, yet do not sin.
Do not let the sun go down on your anger,
and do not give the adversary an opening.
</p>

<p>
Let the one who stole steal no longer,
but rather work with their hands,
so they may have something to share with the one in need.
</p>

<p>
Let no corrupt speech come out of your mouth,
but only what is good for building up,
so it gives grace to those who hear.
</p>

<p>
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
</p>

<p>
Let all bitterness, rage, anger, shouting, and slander be removed from you,
along with all malice.
</p>

<p>
Be kind to one another,
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another,
as God in Christ forgave you.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Day of redemption” refers to the completed covenant deliverance,
the public vindication of the New Covenant people,
and the closure of the old system that condemned them.
This is not a delayed end-of-world event.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Unity is protected, not created</h3>
<p>
Paul does not command them to manufacture unity.
He tells them to keep the unity of the Spirit.
Unity is already a given in Christ.
Their task is to stop behaving like the old divided world still defines them.
</p>

<h3>2) Gifts exist to mature the body, not elevate personalities</h3>
<p>
The ministry gifts are not badges of rank.
They exist to equip the whole body
until the assembly stabilises into mature, shared knowledge and practice.
</p>

<h3>3) “New humanity” is the replacement of the old covenant identity-world</h3>
<p>
This is the core of Ephesians:
a new people has been created.
Old identity markers (Law, boundary, separation) are gone.
New humanity is defined by Christ’s life and Spirit.
</p>

<h3>4) Ethical commands are not Law, but alignment</h3>
<p>
These instructions are not Torah repackaged.
They are what life looks like when accusation is gone,
when peace is real,
and when people actually belong to each other.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
New Creation life is not “try harder.”
It is living from a finished reconciliation.
</p>

<p>
Unity is not a project.
It is a fact.
Maturity is not a badge.
It is stability in love and truth.
</p>

<p>
Paul’s commands are not burdens.
They are alignment with who you already are in Christ:
one body, one Spirit, one household.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still speaking, reacting, or relating
as if the old divided world still defines me —
and what would “truth in love” look like today?
