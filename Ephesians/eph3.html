<h1>Ephesians 3</h1>
<h2>The Mystery Revealed · The Church Displayed · Fullness Known</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Mystery Now Made Known (Eph 3:1–13)</h2>

<p><strong>3:1–3</strong> For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles — assuming you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace given to me for you — that the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote briefly earlier.</p>

<p><strong>3:4–6</strong> When you read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to previous generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>

<p><strong>3:7–9</strong> Of this gospel I was made a servant by the gift of God’s grace given to me through the working of His power. To me — the least of all the saints — this grace was given: to proclaim to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.</p>

<p><strong>3:10–11</strong> This was so that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places, according to the eternal purpose accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p><strong>3:12–13</strong> In Him we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him. Therefore I ask you not to lose heart over my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Strengthened to Know What Is Already Yours (Eph 3:14–21)</h2>

<p><strong>3:14–17</strong> For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that He would grant you — according to the riches of His glory — to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner person, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.</p>

<p><strong>3:18–19</strong> I pray that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled to all the fullness of God.</p>

<p><strong>3:20–21</strong> Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 3 explains <em>why</em> Paul is so confident about unity.
It is not idealism.
It is revelation.
</p>

<p>
The “mystery” is not a secret code.
It is God’s long-hidden purpose now revealed:
Gentiles fully included,
not as guests,
but as co-heirs.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) The mystery is inclusion, not information</h3>
<p>
The mystery is not about dates, charts, or hidden knowledge.
It is about people.
Those once excluded are now fully included in Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) Revelation replaces speculation</h3>
<p>
Paul stresses that this was not figured out by study alone.
It required divine unveiling.
This guards against retrofitting old assumptions onto new realities.
</p>

<h3>3) The church is God’s public display</h3>
<p>
The church is not an afterthought.
It is the stage on which God’s wisdom is displayed —
to earthly and heavenly observers.
Unity itself is the message.
</p>

<h3>4) “Rulers and authorities” are being informed, not consulted</h3>
<p>
The powers are not in charge.
They are witnesses.
God’s wisdom is shown <em>to</em> them,
not negotiated <em>with</em> them.
</p>

<h3>5) Access is already secured</h3>
<p>
Boldness and access are present realities.
Prayer flows from confidence,
not fear of rejection.
</p>

<h3>6) Fullness is meant to be known</h3>
<p>
Paul prays not for believers to receive more,
but to comprehend what they already possess.
This keeps New Creation life grounded, not mystical.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 3 removes “almost” from the Christian life.
You are not on probation.
You are included.
</p>

<p>
The church does not prove God’s wisdom by power displays,
but by reconciled life.
Unity is not strategy.
It is testimony.
</p>

<p>
The prayer is simple:
know what you already have.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where do I still think of myself — or others —
as secondary, conditional, or “less than,”
instead of fully included in Christ?
