<h1>1 Corinthians 9</h1>
<h2>Freedom Surrendered for the Sake of Others</h2>

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Paul’s Apostolic Standing (9:1–6)</h3>

<p>
Am I not free?
Am I not an apostle?
Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?
Are you not my work in the Lord?
</p>

<p>
Even if others question my apostleship,
you do not —
for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
</p>

<p>
This is my defence to those who examine me:
do we not have the right to eat and drink?
Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife,
as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
</p>

<p>
Or is it only Barnabas and I
who have no right to refrain from working?
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Right to Support Explained (9:7–14)</h3>

<p>
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?
Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit?
Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk?
</p>

<p>
I am not saying this merely from human reasoning.
The Law itself says,
“You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”
Is God concerned only about oxen?
</p>

<p>
Was this not written for our sake?
Yes — because the plougher should plough in hope,
and the one threshing in hope of sharing in the crop.
</p>

<p>
If we have sown spiritual things among you,
is it too much if we reap material support from you?
</p>

<p>
If others share this right over you,
do we not even more?
Yet we did not make use of this right.
Instead, we endure everything,
so we do not place any obstacle in the way of the gospel.
</p>

<p>
Do you not know that those who perform temple duties eat from the temple,
and those who serve at the altar share in the offerings?
In the same way,
the Lord has directed that those who proclaim the gospel
are to live from the gospel.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Freedom Voluntarily Set Aside (9:15–18)</h3>

<p>
But I have not used any of these rights.
And I am not writing this so that they will now be applied to me.
I would rather die than have anyone empty my boasting of its meaning.
</p>

<p>
If I proclaim the gospel, I have nothing to boast about,
for necessity is laid upon me.
Woe to me if I do not proclaim it.
</p>

<p>
If I do this willingly, I have a reward.
If unwillingly, I am still entrusted with a stewardship.
What then is my reward?
That in proclaiming the gospel,
I may present it free of charge,
not making full use of my right.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Becoming a Servant to All (9:19–23)</h3>

<p>
Though I am free from all,
I have made myself a servant to all,
so that I may gain more.
</p>

<p>
To the Jews I became as a Jew,
in order to gain Jews.
To those under the Law, as under the Law —
though I myself am not under the Law —
so that I might gain those under the Law.
</p>

<p>
To those outside the Law,
I became as one outside the Law —
not being lawless toward God,
but under the law of Christ —
so that I might gain those outside the Law.
</p>

<p>
To the weak I became weak,
so that I might gain the weak.
I have become all things to all people,
so that by all means I might save some.
</p>

<p>
I do all this for the sake of the gospel,
so that I may share in its blessings.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Discipline with a Purpose (9:24–27)</h3>

<p>
Do you not know that in a race all run,
but only one receives the prize?
Run in such a way that you may obtain it.
</p>

<p>
Everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything.
They do it to receive a perishable crown,
but we an imperishable one.
</p>

<p>
So I do not run aimlessly;
I do not box as one beating the air.
I discipline my body and bring it under control,
so that after preaching to others,
I myself will not be disqualified.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Chapter 8 dealt with freedom and love.
Here Paul uses his own life as the living example.
He proves that real freedom is not insisting on rights,
but laying them down so others are not harmed
and the gospel remains unobstructed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Apostleship is already validated, not awaiting approval</h3>
<p>
Paul does not argue that his authority will one day be confirmed.
He states it is already established by the risen Lord
and by the transformed Corinthian community itself (9:1–2).
</p>

<h3>2) Gospel support is legitimate, but not compulsory</h3>
<p>
Paul affirms the right to material support
while refusing to demand it.
This preserves the gospel’s integrity
in a culture obsessed with patronage and status.
</p>

<h3>3) “Saving some” is lived participation, not postponed destiny</h3>
<p>
Paul’s language of “saving” is relational and present.
It refers to people being drawn out of old identity systems
into shared life in Christ — already unfolding.
</p>

<h3>4) Discipline is about faithfulness, not fear of loss</h3>
<p>
Paul’s self-discipline is not anxiety about salvation.
It is commitment to finish his stewardship well
without undermining the message he proclaims.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Right” (9:4–6):</strong> legitimate entitlement voluntarily surrendered.</li>
  <li><strong>“Under the Law” (9:20):</strong> covenant system no longer binding Paul.</li>
  <li><strong>“Save” (9:22):</strong> bring into lived participation in New Creation life.</li>
  <li><strong>“Disqualified” (9:27):</strong> failing one’s stewardship, not losing union with Christ.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
In the New Creation,
maturity is measured by how easily we release our rights for love.
Freedom reaches its fullest expression
when it is used to serve rather than to assert.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I insisting on my rights
when love would ask me to lay them down?
</p>
