Instruction:
Generate the full HTML code for the next chapter of Matthew using the LOCKED FPBible Matthew Chapter HTML Standard (Revelation 1–style structure/nav/CSS) and the rules below.

THEOLOGICAL LENS (SITE AUDIT COMPLIANT):
- You MUST write all framing, notes, and commentary from a consistent Covenantal / Full Preterist perspective.
- Zero Futurism: if a passage sounds “still pending,” you must explain its fulfillment in the first-century covenant transition (AD 30–70).
- “The End” = end of the Mosaic age (AD 70).
- “The Coming / Parousia” = Christ’s vindication/judgment on Jerusalem and covenantal transition.
- “The Kingdom” = present, settled New Creation reality now.
- Do NOT use “already but not yet” language.

TEXT INTEGRITY (LSV):
- Scripture must be the Literal Standard Version (LSV) text, copied verbatim.
- DO NOT paraphrase, rewrite, modernize, or adjust wording/punctuation.
- Selective Bolding: within the Scripture text, apply <strong> ONLY to the exact words/phrases supplied in the Annotations list. Nothing else gets bolded.

LINK RULES:
- Cross-References MUST link to LSV on eBible.org using:
  https://ebible.org/englsv/BOOK##.htm (e.g., https://ebible.org/englsv/ISA40.htm)
- Prophecy Hub links MUST be internal:
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/index.html#anchor">Theme Name</a>

FORMAT + TEMPLATE:
1) Output valid HTML5.
2) Use the LOCKED Matthew/Revelation-1 style internal CSS and layout (cards/sections/nav/buttons) — do NOT use external CSS.
3) Include top navigation and bottom navigation consistent with the locked Matthew standard (Index + Previous/Next chapter links).

REQUIRED SECTION ORDER (each separated by <hr />):
1. Immediate Context
   - One short paragraph setting the scene in Matthew’s covenant-litigation flow (no fluff).
2. Scripture (LSV)
   - Full chapter text in <div class="scripture-text">.
   - Verse numbers wrapped in <span class="v-num">.
   - Apply selective bolding only per Annotations list.
3. Fulfillment Notes (STRICT)
   - EXACTLY 3–5 lines total.
   - Each line = ONE sentence only.
   - No mini-commentary, no quotes, no “maybe.”
   - Must explicitly sharpen “this generation” / timing where relevant.
4. Annotations
   - Gray/soft box listing key terms and brief definitions (1–2 lines each).
   - Include any covenant idioms relevant to the chapter (e.g., “heaven and earth,” “coming on clouds,” “vineyard,” “outer darkness,” etc.) without bloated essays.
5. Fulfillment Commentary (DEPTH REQUIRED)
   - Minimum 700 words (900+ preferred if the chapter is dense).
   - Break into numbered subheadings.
   - Must connect imagery to covenant realities: Law/Temple/Priesthood/Israel’s leadership/judgment-transfer/New Creation access.
   - Must state the first-century resolution plainly (AD 70 context where applicable).
   - Must avoid repeating the Fulfillment Notes verbatim.
6. Prophecy Hub Links
   - Bullet list of exactly 3 relevant internal themes.
7. Cross-References
   - Bullet list of exactly 3 LSV links (OT/NT mix as appropriate).
8. New Creation Reality
   - Short, grounded: what this means now (presence, access, identity, Spirit-life).
9. Reflection
   - One challenging devotional question (not moralistic, not fear-based).
10. Footer
   - Prev/Next + Index links
   - Official Ko-fi button: https://ko-fi.com/B0B61QC1BU
   - Extended LSV attribution note (as per site standard)
