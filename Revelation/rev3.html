<h1>Revelation 3</h1>
<h2>Wake Up, Hold Fast, Open the Door</h2>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 3 completes Christ’s direct address to the seven churches.
The focus remains internal and covenantal: spiritual condition, faithfulness under pressure,
and responsiveness to Christ’s present authority.
This chapter does not move the story forward in time; it deepens the call to endurance
before covenant judgment unfolds in the visions that follow.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Sardis — Alive in Name, Dead in Reality (3:1–6)</h3>
<p>
The One who holds the Spirit of God and the messengers speaks to Sardis.
They have a reputation for being alive, yet they are dead.
Their works are incomplete before God.
</p>
<p>
They are commanded to wake up, strengthen what remains, remember what they received,
and repent. If they refuse, judgment will come unexpectedly.
Yet a faithful remnant remains—those who will walk with Christ in white.
</p>
<p>
The overcomer is clothed in white, publicly acknowledged,
and not erased from the book of life.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Philadelphia — Little Strength, Great Faithfulness (3:7–13)</h3>
<p>
The Holy and True One speaks to Philadelphia.
Though they have little strength, they have kept Christ’s word
and have not denied His name.
</p>
<p>
An open door is set before them—access and opportunity that no opposition can shut.
Their adversaries will be exposed as false, and vindication will come.
</p>
<p>
They are urged to hold fast.
The overcomer becomes a pillar in God’s temple,
bearing God’s name, the name of the city, and Christ’s new name—
secure covenant belonging.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Laodicea — Lukewarm Self-Sufficiency (3:14–22)</h3>
<p>
The Amen, the faithful and true witness, addresses Laodicea.
They are neither cold nor hot.
Their self-confidence masks spiritual poverty, blindness, and nakedness.
</p>
<p>
Christ counsels them to receive true riches, true sight, and true covering.
His rebuke is an expression of love.
He stands at the door and knocks—calling the community to renewed fellowship.
</p>
<p>
The overcomer is promised shared rule with Christ,
just as He overcame and sat down with the Father.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Spiritual death can coexist with religious reputation</h3>
<p>
Sardis shows that reputation and reality can diverge.
Christ’s judgment is not impressed by public perception.
He evaluates covenant faithfulness, not appearances.
</p>

<h3>2) Weakness does not disqualify faithfulness</h3>
<p>
Philadelphia is not praised for strength but for loyalty.
Access (“the open door”) is given by Christ, not seized by power.
Vindication belongs to those who endure.
</p>

<h3>3) Lukewarmness is covenant complacency</h3>
<p>
Laodicea’s danger is self-sufficiency.
They believe they lack nothing, yet Christ exposes their need.
This is covenant correction, not rejection.
The knock is communal, not individualistic.
</p>

<h3>4) “Coming” language remains covenantal</h3>
<p>
Warnings of unexpected arrival are judicial in nature,
echoing prophetic language of inspection and judgment within history,
not a distant end-of-the-world scenario.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 3 shows that New Creation life requires alertness, loyalty, and humility.
Christ does not abandon His people,
but He does confront complacency and call for renewed responsiveness.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I relying on reputation, strength, or comfort instead of present obedience—
and what would it look like to respond immediately to Christ’s voice?
