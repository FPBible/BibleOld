<h1>About This Project</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible</h2>

<p>
Fulfilled Prophecy Bible is a guided presentation of Scripture that reads each text within its original
historical setting and takes seriously the New Testament’s claim that decisive covenant realities were
fulfilled in Christ, within the apostolic horizon.
</p>

<p>
This is not a new translation, and it does not replace the biblical text.
The Scripture displayed is the <strong>World English Bible (WEB)</strong>.
What this project adds is a fulfilled reading framework:
<strong>Fulfillment Notes</strong> (brief, restrained) and <strong>Prophecy Commentary</strong> (expanded),
so modern readers can follow the Bible’s own prophetic idiom and timing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How This Bible Is Read</h2>

<p>
Biblical language is not flattened into abstract concepts.
Scripture is allowed to speak in its own categories:
covenant, temple, kingdom, judgment, life, death, resurrection, and glory.
</p>

<p>
Where the New Testament speaks of fulfillment, this project does not postpone that fulfillment indefinitely.
It treats fulfillment as announced, accomplished, and revealed in Christ, with historical consequences that
reached their decisive covenant resolution in the first-century transition (AD 30–70).
</p>

<p>
This means prophetic language is read covenantally, not cosmologically.
“Heaven and earth,” “coming,” “day of the Lord,” “fire,” and “resurrection”
are interpreted by Scripture’s own usage and first-century context,
not by later philosophical or modern-scientific assumptions.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scripture, Notes, and Commentary</h2>

<p>
Each chapter is organised with clear separation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scripture (WEB):</strong> the text itself</li>
  <li><strong>Fulfillment Notes:</strong> short, time-bound pointers (kept brief on purpose)</li>
  <li><strong>Prophecy Commentary:</strong> the expanded explanation and cross-references</li>
  <li><strong>Prophecy Hub links:</strong> shared definitions and recurring symbols</li>
</ul>

<p>
Keeping these distinct helps readers see what the text says, then how the fulfilled lens is applied—without
blurring Scripture into interpretation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment and the New Creation</h2>

<p>
Throughout the New Testament, life is described as already given, access as already opened,
judgment as already active, and glory as already being shared.
This project understands those statements not as partial truths waiting for activation, but as declarations of a
completed covenant transition.
</p>

<p>
The New Creation is not a future environment to escape into; it is a present reality revealed in Christ and lived
through union with Him—expressed as righteousness, peace, and Spirit-life now.
</p>

<div class="note">
  Fulfillment is not the end of hope.
  It is the realization of what hope was pointing toward.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>What This Project Is — and Is Not</h2>

<p>
This project is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reading guide, not a denomination</li>
  <li>a theological lens, not a debate platform</li>
  <li>a structured resource designed for clarity and consistency</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a denial of history or continuity</li>
  <li>a dismissal of Scripture’s authority</li>
  <li>an attempt to provoke controversy</li>
</ul>

<p>
It exists to clarify, not to pressure.
To illuminate, not to dominate.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>
Readers are encouraged to move slowly, read contextually, and allow the text itself to shape understanding.
Use the Prophecy Hub when you hit timing language (“near,” “soon,” “this generation”) or prophetic imagery
(“clouds,” “fire,” “stars,” “heaven and earth”).
</p>

<p>
If this perspective is unfamiliar, begin with a Gospel (John or Matthew),
then follow the cross-links as questions arise.
</p>

<p>
The invitation is not to master a system, but to recognise life already present in Christ.
