<h1>1 Corinthians 9</h1>
<h2>Apostolic Rights Relinquished · Love Governs Liberty</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul defends his apostleship, not to elevate himself,
but to make a point about freedom.
He has genuine rights: support, provision, and recognition.
Yet he has chosen not to exercise them.
</p>

<p>
He appeals to common sense, Scripture, and precedent.
Workers deserve benefit from their labour.
Even the Law acknowledged this principle.
Yet Paul refuses to use these rights
so the gospel will not be hindered.
</p>

<p>
Paul reframes freedom as voluntary service.
To Jews, he lived as a Jew.
To those outside the Law, as one outside the Law —
though never outside the law of Christ.
His adaptability is not compromise;
it is love in motion.
</p>

<p>
He concludes with athletic imagery.
Discipline is purposeful.
The goal is not personal status,
but effective participation in the gospel’s advance.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
After teaching that love limits freedom,
Paul demonstrates it in his own life.
He models restraint, not entitlement,
as the mark of mature New Covenant living.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Rights exist — but love decides their use</h3>
<p>
Paul never denies legitimate rights.
He denies that rights must always be exercised.
Freedom is measured by what one can relinquish,
not what one demands.
</p>

<h3>2) Law references are illustrative, not binding</h3>
<p>
Paul uses the Law as wisdom,
not as covenant authority.
The Law supports the point;
it does not govern it.
</p>

<h3>3) “Under the law of Christ” defines the new ethic</h3>
<p>
Paul is neither lawless nor legalistic.
He lives under the law shaped by Christ’s self-giving love.
That law fulfills every command without enforcing one.
</p>

<h3>4) Discipline serves mission, not merit</h3>
<p>
The athletic metaphor is not about earning approval.
It is about intentional living.
Purpose directs energy;
love directs purpose.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Galatians 5 — freedom through love</li>
  <li>Romans 14–15 — restraint for others</li>
  <li>Philippians 2 — self-emptying love</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You are free — not to insist, but to serve.
In Christ, freedom is powerful enough
to lay itself down for another’s good.
That is not weakness.
That is maturity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be clinging to a right
that love is inviting me to release?
</p>
