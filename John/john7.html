  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 7 — Living Water and the Division of the Old World</h2>

  <h3>Jesus and His Brothers</h3>

  <p>
    After this, Jesus walked in Galilee.
    He did not want to walk in Judea,
    because the Jews were seeking to kill Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:1)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the Jewish Feast of Booths was near.
    So His brothers said to Him,
    “Leave here and go into Judea,
    so Your disciples may also see the works You are doing.
    No one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly.
    If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.”
    For even His brothers did not believe in Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:2–5)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said to them,
    “My time has not yet come,
    but your time is always ready.
    The world cannot hate you,
    but it hates Me because I testify about it,
    that its works are evil.
    You go up to the feast.
    I am not going up to this feast yet,
    because My time has not yet fully come”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:6–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After saying this, He remained in Galilee.
    But when His brothers had gone up to the feast,
    then He also went up — not publicly, but in private
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:9–10)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Division Over Jesus</h3>

  <p>
    The Jews were looking for Him at the feast and saying,
    “Where is He?”
    And there was much murmuring among the crowds concerning Him.
    Some said, “He is good.”
    Others said, “No, He leads the people astray.”
    Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Jews
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:11–13)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    About the middle of the feast,
    Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
    The Jews marveled, saying,
    “How does this man know letters, having never studied?”
    Jesus answered them,
    “My teaching is not Mine,
    but His who sent Me.
    If anyone desires to do His will,
    he will know whether the teaching is from God
    or whether I speak from Myself”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:14–17)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory,
    but the one who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true,
    and in him there is no unrighteousness.
    Did not Moses give you the law?
    Yet none of you keeps the law.
    Why do you seek to kill Me?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:18–19)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crowd answered,
    “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?”
    Jesus answered,
    “I did one work, and you all marvel.
    Moses gave you circumcision,
    and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
    If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath,
    so that the law of Moses is not broken,
    are you angry with Me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?
    Don’t judge according to appearance,
    but judge with righteous judgment”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:20–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Is This the Christ?</h3>

  <p>
    Some of the people of Jerusalem said,
    “Isn’t this the man they seek to kill?
    And look, He speaks openly, and they say nothing to Him.
    Have the rulers truly known that this is the Christ?
    But we know where this man is from.
    When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:25–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,
    “You know Me, and you know where I am from.
    I have not come of Myself,
    but He who sent Me is true,
    whom you do not know.
    I know Him, because I am from Him,
    and He sent Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:28–29)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were seeking to arrest Him,
    but no one laid a hand on Him,
    because His hour had not yet come.
    Yet many from the crowd believed in Him and said,
    “When the Christ comes,
    will He do more signs than this man has done?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:30–31)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Promise of Living Water</h3>

  <p>
    The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him,
    and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest Him.
    Jesus said,
    “I will be with you a little while longer,
    and then I go to Him who sent Me.
    You will seek Me and not find Me,
    and where I am, you cannot come”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:32–34)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the last and greatest day of the feast,
    Jesus stood and cried out,
    “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
    Whoever believes in Me,
    as the Scripture has said,
    from within him will flow rivers of living water”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:37–38)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He said this about the Spirit,
    whom those believing in Him were about to receive;
    for the Spirit was not yet given,
    because Jesus was not yet glorified
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:39)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Division and Rejection</h3>

  <p>
    When the crowd heard these words,
    some said, “This is truly the Prophet.”
    Others said, “This is the Christ.”
    But some said,
    “Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
    Doesn’t Scripture say that the Christ comes from David’s offspring,
    and from Bethlehem?”
    So there was a division in the crowd because of Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:40–43)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of them wanted to arrest Him,
    but no one laid hands on Him.
    The officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees,
    who said to them, “Why didn’t you bring Him?”
    The officers answered,
    “No one ever spoke like this man.”
    The Pharisees replied,
    “Have you also been deceived?
    Has any ruler or Pharisee believed in Him?
    But this crowd that doesn’t know the law is cursed”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:44–49)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nicodemus — the one who had gone to Him earlier —
    said to them,
    “Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he does?”
    They replied,
    “Are you also from Galilee?
    Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v50" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:50–52)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 7</h2>

  <h3>1. Feast of Booths: the fading wilderness system</h3>
  <p>
    The Feast of Booths celebrates Israel’s wilderness dwelling.
    Jesus shows up as the true fulfillment of that story.
    The old sheltering system is passing;
    the true dwelling of God with humanity is standing in front of them
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN01.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 1:14)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The world hates Jesus because He exposes it</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says the world hates Him because He testifies that its works are evil
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:7)</a>.
    “World” here is not the planet,
    but the old covenant religious system resisting its own replacement.
  </p>

  <h3>3. “Judge with righteous judgment” = covenant discernment</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus exposes selective law-keeping
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:24)</a>.
    The law they appeal to condemns them,
    because it was never meant to be an end in itself.
    It pointed to Christ, who is now present.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Living water is the Spirit of the New Creation</h3>
  <p>
    The climactic cry of the feast
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:37)</a>
    announces what John later explains:
    rivers of living water = the Spirit
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:39)</a>.
    The New Covenant is about to overflow beyond temple walls
    into living people.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Division is the sign of the age-change</h3>
  <p>
    Everywhere Jesus appears, division follows
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:43)</a>.
    This is the separating work of judgment:
    light from darkness,
    old world from New Creation.
    Neutral ground disappears.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Authorities reject Him; witnesses hesitate</h3>
  <p>
    The leaders dismiss Jesus because He does not fit their expectations
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:48)</a>.
    Yet even officers sent to arrest Him return empty-handed.
    The old order senses its end but cannot stop it.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 7 is a chapter of exposure.
    The feast, the law, the authorities, and the crowds are all divided by Jesus.
    Living water is offered,
    but only those willing to step out of the old world
    can drink it.
  </p>
