<h1>John 13</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>
<hr/>

<p>Before the Passover, Jesus knew that His hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.</p>
<p>During the meal, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, that He had come from God and was returning to God, Jesus rose from the table. He laid aside His outer garments, took a towel, and began to wash the disciples’ feet.</p>
<p>When He came to Simon Peter, Peter objected. Jesus answered that what He was doing would be understood later. When Peter refused again, Jesus said that unless He washed him, Peter would have no share with Him. Peter then asked for more than his feet, but Jesus explained that one who has bathed is already clean — only the feet need washing.</p>
<p>After washing their feet, Jesus said that He had given them an example. If the Lord and Teacher had washed their feet, they also ought to serve one another. True blessedness comes not from knowing these things, but from doing them.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Jesus spoke of betrayal, fulfilling Scripture. He was troubled in spirit and declared that one of them would betray Him. When the beloved disciple asked who it was, Jesus indicated Judas by giving him the morsel. After Judas took it, he went out — and it was night.</p>
<hr/>

<p>After Judas left, Jesus said that the Son of Man was now being glorified, and God was being glorified in Him. He told the disciples that where He was going, they could not yet come.</p>
<p>Jesus gave them a new commandment: to love one another as He had loved them. By this love, all would know they were His disciples.</p>
<p>Peter insisted he would follow Jesus anywhere, even to death. Jesus replied that Peter would deny Him three times before morning.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, in private with His disciples</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The inner circle of disciples on the night of Passover</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The final instruction before the cross as the old covenant meal gives way to New Covenant reality</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus redefines greatness, leadership, and holiness on the eve of covenant transition.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) “Having loved them to the end”</h3>
<p>This is covenant language. Jesus loves His people through the completion of the old age and into the New Creation.</p>
<h3>2) Foot-washing replaces hierarchy</h3>
<p>Jesus dismantles power-based leadership. Authority in the New Covenant flows through self-giving service, not status.</p>
<h3>3) What ended</h3>
<p>Religious hierarchy, purity markers, and greatness defined by rank or rule-keeping.</p>
<h3>4) What replaced it</h3>
<p>A community defined by mutual service, shared cleansing, and love patterned after Christ Himself.</p>
<h3>5) Clean, but still being washed</h3>
<p>The disciples are already clean covenantally, yet still learning to walk free of old patterns. Identity precedes behavior.</p>
<h3>6) Betrayal reveals the old world</h3>
<p>Judas’ departure into the night symbolizes the passing of the old order as the Light remains with the faithful.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This pattern of servant love becomes the defining mark of the New Covenant community as the temple system fades away.</p>

<h2>Key Idioms &amp; Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hour</strong> — the appointed time of covenant completion</li>
<li><strong>Washed / clean</strong> — covenant cleansing, not ritual purity</li>
<li><strong>Night</strong> — departure of the old order</li>
<li><strong>New commandment</strong> — love as the new covenant law</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>Greatness is no longer measured by position or performance. Life in the New Creation is expressed through love that stoops, serves, and gives itself away.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Where might Christ be inviting you to lay aside status and practice love that serves?</p>
