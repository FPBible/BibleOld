<h1>John 17</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>
<hr/>

<p>Jesus lifted His eyes to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, so that the Son may glorify You. You gave Him authority over all flesh, so that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.”</p>
<p>“This is eternal life: that they know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You sent. I have glorified You on the earth by finishing the work You gave Me to do. Now glorify Me with the glory I had with You before the world existed.”</p>
<hr/>

<p>Jesus said He had revealed the Father’s name to the people given to Him. They had received His words and believed He was sent from God.</p>
<p>He prayed not for the world, but for those given to Him, asking that they would be kept in unity. He said that while He was with them, He guarded them, and none was lost except the son of destruction, fulfilling Scripture.</p>
<p>Jesus said He was returning to the Father and spoke these things so that His joy might be fulfilled in them. He explained that they were not of the world, just as He was not of the world.</p>
<p>He did not ask that they be taken out of the world, but that they be protected from the evil one. He prayed that they would be sanctified in truth — God’s word is truth.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Jesus prayed not only for the disciples, but also for those who would believe through their word. He prayed that all of them would be one, just as the Father is in Him and He is in the Father.</p>
<p>He said that this unity would show the world that the Father sent Him. He gave them the glory He had received, so they might be one as He and the Father are one.</p>
<p>Jesus prayed that those given to Him would be with Him and see His glory. He declared that the Father’s love would be in them, and that He Himself would be in them.</p>
<hr/><h2>Scripture (WEB)</h2><p class="note">Original text: <a href="https://ebible.org/web/JHN17.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John 17 — WEB</a></p><div class="scripture-text" data-web="https://ebible.org/web/JHN17.htm">

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The Father, in the presence of the disciples</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The sealing prayer before the cross, completing the transition from old covenant to New Creation</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> This prayer defines eternal life, unity, glory, and mission in covenant—not institutional—terms.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) Eternal life is knowing God</h3>
<p>Eternal life is not endless duration after death. It is covenant relationship — shared life with the Father through the Son.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>Glory located in temple, nation, ethnicity, and separation between God and people.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Shared glory, shared life, and shared unity rooted in union with Christ.</p>
<h3>4) “Before the world existed”</h3>
<p>This language reaches behind the old covenant order to God’s eternal purpose now revealed in the Son. It does not require modern cosmology; it expresses covenant priority and origin.</p>
<h3>5) Unity is the witness</h3>
<p>The oneness Jesus prays for is not organizational agreement but shared participation in divine life. This unity testifies that the mission succeeded.</p>
<h3>6) Not taken out of the world</h3>
<p>The disciples are not removed from history. They remain present during the covenant collapse, bearing witness as the old order passes away.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This prayer is answered through resurrection, Pentecost, apostolic mission, and the public end of the temple system in AD 70. The unity and glory Jesus prayed for stand completed.</p>

<p>You are already included in the prayer Jesus prayed. His unity, glory, and life are not future goals — they are present realities in Christ.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>If eternal life is knowing God now, where might you still be postponing what is already yours?</p>
