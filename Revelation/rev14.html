      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Chapter 13 ended with the terrifying vision of the Beast forcing the known world to worship its image and take its mark. The immediate question for John’s first-century audience was: <em>Did the Beast win? Did anyone survive the persecution?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Chapter 14 provides the immediate, glorious answer. John looks up and sees the 144,000—the exact group of Jewish-Christian believers sealed back in Chapter 7—standing completely victorious with the Lamb on Mount Zion. They did not take the mark. They did not compromise. Following this assurance, three angels announce the impending fall of Babylon (apostate Jerusalem) and the Son of Man swings His sickle to harvest the earth, officially concluding the Old Covenant age.

      <div class="scripture-text">
        <span class="v-num">1</span> I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.<br />
        <span class="v-num">3</span> They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> He said with a loud voice, “Fear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> Another, a second angel, followed, saying, “Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.<br />
        <span class="v-num">11</span> The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.<br />
        <span class="v-num">12</span> Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’”
        “Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">14</span> I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.<br />
        <span class="v-num">15</span> Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, “Send your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">16</span> He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.<br />
        <span class="v-num">17</span> Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle.<br />
        <span class="v-num">18</span> Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Send your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth’s grapes are fully ripe!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">19</span> The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.<br />
        <span class="v-num">20</span> The wine press was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mount Zion (v. 1):</strong> This is not the physical dirt hill in the modern Middle East. As Hebrews 12:22 makes clear, the New Covenant believers have <em>already</em> "come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem." It is the spiritual gathering place of the victorious Church.</li>
        <li><strong>The First Fruits (v. 4):</strong> The 144,000 are explicitly called "first fruits." First fruits are the very first crop harvested at the beginning of a season. This firmly locks the identity of the 144,000 to the first-century Jewish converts (see James 1:18), proving they are not a futuristic group waiting at the end of time.</li>
        <li><strong>The Harvest of the Earth (v. 15):</strong> In Matthew 13:39, Jesus taught that the "harvest is the end of the age" (the end of the Old Covenant *aion*, not the end of the physical cosmos). The harvest separates the faithful wheat from the unfaithful chaff. It was completely fulfilled in the AD 70 transition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>not defiled with women / virgins</strong> — This is spiritual imagery, not a literal command for celibacy. In the prophets, idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness are constantly called "adultery." These believers are "virgins" because they refused to commit spiritual adultery by bowing to the Beast or the apostate Temple system.</li>
        <li><strong>fire and sulfur / smoke goes up forever</strong> — Standard Old Testament prophetic idiom for absolute, irreversible national destruction (first used of Sodom and Gomorrah, and later of Edom in Isaiah 34:10). It denotes finality of judgment, not a literal chamber of eternal conscious torture.</li>
        <li><strong>1,600 stadia</strong> — A Roman stadium was about 600 feet. 1,600 stadia equals approximately 180 to 200 miles. This is the exact geographical length of the land of Palestine. The blood covering the land signifies the total devastation of Judea by the Roman army.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Victorious Remnant (vv. 1–5)</h3>
      <p>
        The Beast in Chapter 13 marked his followers on the forehead with his name. Here, the Lamb stands with His 144,000 followers, marked on their foreheads with the Father's name. The Beast forces worship through economic threats and violence; the Lamb leads a people who follow Him voluntarily, "wherever he goes." 
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the "first fruits." They are the original Jewish remnant (the early church of Acts) who escaped the corruption of the Old Order and formed the foundational nucleus of the New Creation. Their victory is absolute.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Fall of Babylon Announced (vv. 6–8)</h3>
      <p>
        The second angel makes a shocking declaration: "Babylon the great has fallen." Notice the tense—it is stated as a past, completed event, even though historically the destruction of Jerusalem was still a few moments away. In prophetic literature, when God decrees a judgment, it is so certain to happen that it is spoken of as already finished. Apostate Jerusalem had poisoned the nations with her unfaithfulness, and her hour was up.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Blessing on the Dead (vv. 9–13)</h3>
      <p>
        A severe warning is given to anyone who compromises and takes the mark of the Beast (participating in the Imperial Cult). But in verse 13, a profound paradigm shift occurs: <em>"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why "from now on"? Under the Old Covenant, when a saint died, they went to Abraham's Bosom (Sheol/Hades) to wait for the atoning work of the Messiah to be finished. But because the covenant transition is finalizing, the waiting room is emptying. "From now on," believers who die in the Lord enter immediately into the unhindered presence of God. They rest from their labors.
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Wheat and the Grapes (vv. 14–20)</h3>
      
      <p>
        John witnesses two distinct harvests. First, the Son of Man swings His sickle to reap the "harvest of the earth" (the wheat). This is the gathering of the righteous into the safety of the New Covenant barns, completely fulfilling John the Baptist's prophecy in Matthew 3:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, an angel swings a sickle to harvest the "grapes" of the earth, throwing them into the great winepress of God's wrath. This is the horrifying judgment upon the unrepentant nation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Verse 20 notes that the winepress was trodden <strong>"outside of the city."</strong> Hebrews 13:12 reminds us that Jesus was crucified <em>outside the city gate</em>. Therefore, the judgment falls outside the city. Historically, during the Jewish-Roman war, the valleys surrounding Jerusalem (especially the Kidron Valley) literally flowed with the blood of hundreds of thousands of slaughtered zealots and citizens as the Roman siege engines crushed the rebellion. The hyperbole of blood reaching the horses' bridles over the exact length of Palestine communicates a total, inescapable national slaughter.

      <p>
        The harvest is over. The Old Covenant age was completely wrapped up in the first century, and the wheat was securely gathered into the barn of the New Covenant. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> You do not have to wait for a future rapture to stand on Mount Zion; by faith in the Lamb, you are standing there right now. You are marked with the Father's name, permanently redeemed, and invited to sing the new song of finished salvation.
