<h1>John 6</h1>
<h2>Bread of Life and the Last Day</h2>

<p>
John 6 presents one of the most misunderstood discourses in the Gospel.
Here Jesus confronts expectations shaped by Moses, manna, and national hope,
and redirects them toward Himself as the source of life in the New Creation.
</p>

<h3>The Sign: Provision That Exposes Motives</h3>

<p>
Jesus feeds the crowd in abundance.
The sign echoes Israel’s wilderness story,
but the response reveals a deeper problem:
the people pursue Jesus not for life,
but for provision.
</p>

<p>
They want bread that sustains the old order.
Jesus offers Himself as the bread that replaces it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:1–15)</a>
</p>

<h3>True Bread from Heaven</h3>

<p>
The crowd appeals to Moses and manna.
Jesus corrects them sharply:
Moses did not give the true bread.
The Father now gives bread from heaven —
not as substance, but as a person.
</p>

<p>
Bread is no longer something received daily.
It is someone received fully.
Life is not sustained by ritual provision,
but by union with the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:31–35)</a>
</p>

<h3>Life Given, Not Delayed</h3>

<p>
Jesus declares that all who come to Him will never hunger,
and all who trust Him will never thirst.
This is not promise of future satisfaction,
but announcement of present fulfillment.
</p>

<p>
Those given to the Son are secure —
not because they will be raised later,
but because life has already been granted.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:37–40)</a>
</p>

  <strong>Note — “The Last Day” in John 6</strong><br />
  In John’s Gospel, “the last day” refers to the climax of the old covenant age —
  the closing of the temple-centered world —
  not the end of physical history.
  Resurrection language here describes covenant transition,
  not postponed biological expectation.<br /><br />
  See:
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/2peter3.html">2 Peter 3 — Heavens and Earth</a> |
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15 — Resurrection and Victory</a>
</div>

<h3>Drawn by the Father</h3>

<p>
Jesus explains that coming to Him is not human initiative,
but divine action.
Those drawn by the Father are drawn out of a failing order
into life that endures.
</p>

<p>
Learning from God no longer means mastering Torah,
but recognizing the One whom God has sent.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:44–45)</a>
</p>

<h3>Eating and Drinking: Participation, Not Ritual</h3>

<p>
Jesus’ language intensifies:
eating His flesh and drinking His blood.
This is not literal consumption.
It is covenant participation.
</p>

<p>
To “eat” is to receive.
To “drink” is to internalize.
Life is no longer accessed through sacrifice,
but through union with the self-giving Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:51–58)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Clarification — Resurrection and Participation</strong><br />
  Jesus does not promise resurrection as a future reward
  for correct belief.
  He identifies Himself as life now.
  Participation in Him is participation in resurrection life,
  explained later by the apostles in covenantal terms.
</div>

<h3>The Spirit Gives Life</h3>

<p>
When many are offended and withdraw,
Jesus clarifies the meaning of His words:
“the flesh profits nothing;
the Spirit gives life.”
</p>

<p>
This is decisive.
Life does not come through material continuity,
religious effort, or physical descent.
It comes through the Spirit’s work in Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:63)</a>
</p>

<h3>Responses Reveal Allegiance</h3>

<p>
Many turn away.
The discourse has dismantled their expectations.
Jesus does not soften His claim.
</p>

<p>
Peter responds for the faithful remnant:
“You have the words of eternal life.”
Not future words.
Present ones.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm">(John 6:66–69)</a>
</p>
