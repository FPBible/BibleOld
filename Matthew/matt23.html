      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Matthew 23 is the covenant courtroom verdict on Israel’s leadership: Jesus exposes the hypocrisy of the house,
          pronounces covenant “woes,” seals the timing on the coming accountability, and announces the desolation of the
          temple-centered world immediately before the Olivet discourse (Matthew 24).

        <p><span class="v-num">13</span>“<strong>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!</strong> For you devour widows’ houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.</p>

        <p><span class="v-num">14</span>“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you don’t enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.‡ Some Greek texts reverse the order of verses 13 and 14, and some omit verse 13, numbering verse 14 as 13.

        <p><span class="v-num">15</span>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna‡ or, Hell as yourselves.</p>

        <p><span class="v-num">34</span>Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,</p>
        <p><span class="v-num">35</span>that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.</p>

      <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Chapter Is a Covenant Verdict, Not a Personality Clash</h3>
      <p>
        Matthew 23 is often flattened into “Jesus is angry at religious people,” but Matthew is doing something tighter: this is covenant litigation.
        The scribes and Pharisees are not random opponents; they are the public stewards of Israel’s covenant life, and Jesus is the covenant Lord confronting a failed administration.
        That’s why the language is formal, repetitive, and absolute: “woe” after “woe.”
        In the prophets, “woe” is courtroom speech—an announced consequence on a covenant-breaking party.
        So the tone is not Jesus venting; it’s Jesus issuing verdicts that explain why the old house will not survive the transition.
      </p>

      <h3>2) “Moses’ Seat” and the Collapse of the Authority Machine</h3>
      <p>
        “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat” identifies the authority structure: these men claim to speak for the covenant.
        Jesus acknowledges the seat (the public reading/teaching role) but unmasks the contradiction: “they say, and don’t do.”
        The Mosaic age ran on mediated authority—priests, scribes, rulings, separation lines, and managed access.
        When that stewardship becomes self-protective and performative, it stops being a servant of the covenant and becomes a replacement for it.
        That’s why Jesus exposes their pattern: heavy burdens for others, zero lifting for themselves, religious display, status addiction, and honor-hunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In covenant terms, that’s a betrayal of Moses, not loyalty to Moses.
        And it matters because the Kingdom is not another layer of managed religion; it is the arrival of the King and the reconstitution of God’s people in Him.
        The New Covenant does not expand the burden-machine—it replaces it with direct access, internal law (Spirit-life), and a new kind of leadership: servanthood.
        That is why Jesus tells His disciples not to chase titles and not to copy the authority theater.
        The old system measures “greatness” by rank; the Kingdom measures greatness by service because the presence of God is no longer brokered by a class.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Woes Explain Why the House Will Be Left</h3>
      <p>
        The central accusation is not “they’re imperfect,” but “they block the Kingdom.”
        They “shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men”—meaning they oppose the very covenant fulfillment they claim to represent.
        They devour widows’ houses (covenant injustice), they weaponize prayers (pious cover), they make converts and then train them into deeper Gehenna-trajectory (deeper bondage),
        they turn temple/altar oaths into loophole games (a sign that sacred things are being used for power), and they major on microscopic tithes while abandoning justice, mercy, and faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        That last one is huge: Jesus does not deny that details matter, but He exposes what the old house had become—precision without compassion.
        The covenant was never designed to produce a people who can count herbs while crushing humans.
        So Jesus repeatedly paints the same picture from different angles: clean outside, rotten inside; beautiful tomb, full of death; decorated prophets’ graves, but still sons of the prophet-killers.
        The “woes” are essentially a listing of covenant evidence explaining why the old administration is being removed.
      </p>

      <h3>4) “This Generation” Locks the Fulfillment Horizon</h3>
      <p>
        Verse 36 is the time-stamp that futurism always tries to dull: “All these things will come upon this generation.”
        In Matthew’s flow, this is not a vague “people like this” statement; it is a direct address to the contemporaries who are rejecting the King.
        It ties the coming accountability to the same covenant transition Jesus has been warning about across Matthew:
        the vineyard stewardship ending, the kingdom taken from corrupt tenants, the house built on sand collapsing, and the approaching desolation of Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full Preterism reads this cleanly: Jesus is describing the covenant consequences that culminated in the first-century judgment on Jerusalem and the temple system.
        That is the historical “arrival” of the verdict: the old covenant world (as a governing system) is removed, and the New Covenant stands without a rival house.
        Matthew 23 is therefore not “still pending”; it is the formal pronouncement immediately before Matthew 24 spells out the mechanics and the near-term timeline.
      </p>

      <h3>5) “Your House… Desolate” and the Shift of the Dwelling</h3>
      <p>
        “Behold, your house is left to you desolate” is covenant-shattering language.
        The temple was called “the house,” the place where God’s name dwelt under the old administration.
        Jesus calls it “your house” and announces abandonment—because the true dwelling is no longer tied to that structure once Messiah is present.
        This is not God “giving up on people”; it is God ending a covenant form that has reached its appointed conclusion and is now being used as resistance to the King.
      </p>
      <p>
        The line also answers the question: “If God judged Jerusalem, was it arbitrary?”
        No—Matthew 23 lays out the covenant reasons.
        The house is left desolate because the stewards turned it into a theater of self-importance, a marketplace of power, and a weapon against mercy.
        The New Covenant reality is the opposite: God with His people, not behind a veil; righteousness as life, not a burden; leadership as service, not control.
      </p>

      <h3>6) The Tear in the Middle: Lament, Not Hatred</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter ends in tears: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem… how often I would have gathered… and you would not.”
        This matters because it shows what judgment is doing here: it is not spite; it is the tragic consequence of refusal.
        Jesus is not delighting in destruction; He is grieving the city’s covenant history of rejecting sent ones.
        Judgment is the covenant end of a path, not a random act.
        In the transition (AD 30–70), the offer was real, the gathering was offered, and the refusal was chosen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put it together: Matthew 23 is the covenant verdict that clears the stage for the Olivet discourse.
        It diagnoses leadership failure, announces the end of the old house, locks the timing to “this generation,” and reveals the heart of Christ—justice, mercy, and a desire to gather.
        The outcome is first-century resolution, and the resulting reality for believers is settled access in the New Creation, not fear of a still-pending doom.
