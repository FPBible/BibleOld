<h1>John 20</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Empty Tomb (John 20:1–10)</h2>

<p>On the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken away. She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple and said that the Lord had been taken out of the tomb.</p>

<p>Peter and the other disciple ran to the tomb. The other disciple arrived first and saw the linen cloths lying there, but did not enter. Peter then entered and saw the cloths, and the face cloth folded separately. The other disciple entered, saw, and believed — though they did not yet understand the Scripture that He must rise from the dead. Then they returned to their homes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Mary Meets the Risen Lord (John 20:11–18)</h2>

<p>Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. She looked inside and saw two angels who asked why she was weeping. She answered that they had taken her Lord.</p>

<p>Turning around, she saw Jesus standing there, but did not recognize Him. Jesus asked why she was weeping and whom she was seeking. Thinking He was the gardener, she asked where the body had been taken.</p>

<p>Jesus said her name, “Mary.” She recognized Him and called Him Teacher. Jesus told her not to cling to Him, for He had not yet ascended to the Father. He told her to go and tell the brothers that He was ascending to His Father and their Father.</p>

<p>Mary went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Peace and Commission (John 20:19–23)</h2>

<p>That evening, the disciples were gathered behind locked doors for fear of the authorities. Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” He showed them His hands and His side.</p>

<p>Jesus said again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” He breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain them, they are retained.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Thomas and Belief (John 20:24–31)</h2>

<p>Thomas was not present when Jesus appeared. He said that unless he saw and touched the wounds, he would not believe.</p>

<p>Eight days later, Jesus appeared again. He invited Thomas to touch His wounds. Thomas answered, “My Lord and my God.”</p>

<p>Jesus said that Thomas believed because he had seen, but blessed are those who believe without seeing.</p>

<p>John concludes that these signs were written so that readers may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing they may have life in His name.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> The risen Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Disciples and witnesses of the resurrection</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The public unveiling of New Creation life following covenant death</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Resurrection confirms the completion of the old age and the arrival of a new mode of life rooted in the Spirit.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) The first day signals New Creation</h3>
<p>The resurrection occurs on the first day of the week, echoing Genesis language. This is not mere chronology — it announces a new beginning.</p>

<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>The reign of death under the Law, temple-based mediation, and fear-driven discipleship.</p>

<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Life through union with the risen Christ, Spirit-empowered mission, and peace replacing fear.</p>

<h3>4) “Do not cling to Me”</h3>
<p>Jesus signals a shift from physical proximity to relational union through the Spirit. The old way of knowing Him is giving way to a greater one.</p>

<h3>5) Breathing the Spirit</h3>
<p>This echoes Genesis creation imagery. Humanity is being reconstituted as New Creation people.</p>

<h3>6) Authority to forgive</h3>
<p>This is covenant authority to announce release from sin and death — not institutional control, but Spirit-led proclamation.</p>

<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The resurrection initiates the New Creation era, publicly confirmed through apostolic witness and completed with the removal of the old covenant world in AD 70.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>If resurrection life is already present, where might fear still be shaping your decisions?</p>
