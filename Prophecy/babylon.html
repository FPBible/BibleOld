<h1>Babylon / Harlot / City</h1>
<h2>Covenant Judgement Language in the Prophets and Revelation</h2>

<p>
  “Babylon” in Scripture is not primarily a geographic prediction but a <strong>prophetic title</strong>.
  It functions as covenant vocabulary for a city, system, or leadership body that has become unfaithful,
  oppressive, and ripe for judgement. Revelation gathers this long-standing prophetic pattern and applies
  it to a first-century covenant crisis.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) City Language as Covenant Identity</h2>
<p>
  In the Hebrew Scriptures, cities are not neutral locations; they are <em>covenant identities</em>.
  Jerusalem, Samaria, Nineveh, Tyre, and Babylon are all addressed as moral agents.
  A “city” represents a people organised under leadership, worship, law, and power.
</p>
<p>
  When prophets speak against a city, they are not forecasting urban demolition in isolation;
  they are announcing covenant judgement against an entrenched order that has violated its calling.
  Revelation inherits this framework wholesale.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) Harlot Imagery and Covenant Unfaithfulness</h2>
<p>
  Harlot imagery is not sexual sensationalism; it is covenant language.
  Throughout the prophets, harlotry describes a people who were joined to God
  yet turned to other sources of power, security, and allegiance.
</p>
<p>
  Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea all portray covenant infidelity in marital terms.
  Revelation’s “great harlot” stands firmly in this tradition.
  The charge is not novelty — it is continuity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Why “Babylon” Is Used</h2>
<p>
  “Babylon” functions as a <strong>loaded prophetic symbol</strong>.
  It recalls exile, oppression, temple destruction, blood-guilt, and resistance to God’s purposes.
  To call a first-century power structure “Babylon” is to accuse it of playing the same covenant role
  as historic oppressors of God’s people.
</p>
<p>
  This naming is judicial, not poetic.
  It announces that the system addressed has crossed the line from covenant stewardship
  into covenant liability.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Blood-Guilt and Persecution</h2>
<p>
  Revelation’s Babylon is repeatedly charged with blood-guilt:
  the blood of prophets, saints, and witnesses.
  This aligns directly with Jesus’ covenant lawsuit in Matthew 23,
  where Jerusalem is held accountable for the accumulated blood of the righteous.
</p>
<p>
  Prophetic judgement falls not because a city exists,
  but because it has become a persecuting authority that resists repentance,
  silences testimony, and claims divine legitimacy while acting unjustly.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) What Babylon Is NOT</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not a coded reference to modern nation-states.</li>
  <li>Not a newspaper-driven end-times puzzle.</li>
  <li>Not a future global super-capital waiting to be identified.</li>
  <li>Not an excuse for fear-based speculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These readings flatten prophetic language and detach it from its covenant roots.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) First-Century Horizon and Judgement</h2>
<p>
  Revelation is addressed to real first-century assemblies living under intense pressure.
  Babylon’s judgement is portrayed as imminent, sudden, and decisive —
  language that only makes sense if the audience could witness its outcome.
</p>
<p>
  This does not require reducing Babylon to a single street address.
  It requires recognising how prophetic symbols operate:
  they describe covenant collapse and transfer of authority,
  not merely bricks and mortar.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7) Relationship to New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>
  Babylon and New Jerusalem are deliberately contrasted.
  One is corrupt, persecuting, and passing away.
  The other is pure, faithful, and enduring.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a tale of two future cities;
  it is a covenant contrast between an old order being judged
  and a new order being revealed.
  One must fall for the other to be unveiled.
</p>
