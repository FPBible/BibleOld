<h1>John 12</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.<br/>
So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.<br/>
Therefore Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed Jesusâ€™s feet and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.<br/>
Then Judas Iscariot, Simonâ€™s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,<br/>
â€œWhy wasnâ€™t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?â€<br/>
Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.<br/>
But Jesus said, â€œLeave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.<br/>
For you always have the poor with you, but you donâ€™t always have me.â€<br/>
A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesusâ€™ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.<br/>
But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,<br/>
because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.<br/>
On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br/>
they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him, and cried out, â€œHosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!â€<br/>
Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,<br/>
â€œDonâ€™t be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkeyâ€™s colt.â€<br/>
His disciples didnâ€™t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.<br/>
The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead was testifying about it.<br/>
For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.<br/>
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, â€œSee how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.â€<br/>
Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.<br/>
These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, â€œSir, we want to see Jesus.â€<br/>
Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.<br/>
Jesus answered them, â€œThe time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.<br/>
Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.<br/>
He who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.<br/>
If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.<br/>
â€œNow my soul is troubled. What shall I say? â€˜Father, save me from this time?â€™ But I came to this time for this cause.<br/>
Father, glorify your name!â€<br/>
Then a voice came out of the sky, saying, â€œI have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.â€<br/>
Therefore the multitude who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, â€œAn angel has spoken to him.â€<br/>
Jesus answered, â€œThis voice hasnâ€™t come for my sake, but for your sakes.<br/>
Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.<br/>
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.â€<br/>
But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.<br/>
The multitude answered him, â€œWe have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, â€˜The Son of Man must be lifted up?â€™ Who is this Son of Man?â€<br/>
Jesus therefore said to them, â€œYet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesnâ€™t overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesnâ€™t know where he is going.<br/>
While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light.â€ Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.<br/>
But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didnâ€™t believe in him,<br/>
that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,<br/>
â€œLord, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?â€<br/>
For this cause they couldnâ€™t believe, for Isaiah said again,<br/>
â€œHe has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them.â€<br/>
Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.<br/>
Nevertheless even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didnâ€™t confess it, so that they wouldnâ€™t be put out of the synagogue,<br/>
for they loved menâ€™s praise more than Godâ€™s praise.<br/>
Jesus cried out and said, â€œWhoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.<br/>
He who sees me sees him who sent me.<br/>
I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.<br/>
If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesnâ€™t believe, I donâ€™t judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.<br/>
He who rejects me, and doesnâ€™t receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke will judge him in the last day.<br/>
For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.<br/>
I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.â€

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, publicly in Jerusalem</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Israel at Passover, including leaders and the crowds</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The final public announcement that the old covenant world is ending and the New Creation is arriving through the cross</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> This chapter openly declares that death, judgment, kingship, and glory converge in the Sonâ€™s lifting up.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) The anointing confirms the hour</h3>
<p>Mary anoints Jesus for burial before the cross occurs. The transition is already set in motion. Resurrection life will come through covenant death.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>Messianic expectations of political triumph, temple-centered glory, and preservation of the old order.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Glory revealed through self-giving love, a kingdom established through death and resurrection, and a people gathered beyond Israel.</p>
<h3>4) Greeks signal covenant expansion</h3>
<p>The request from Greeks shows the scope of what is coming. The old boundary is dissolving; the harvest is about to multiply.</p>
<h3>5) Judgment is now</h3>
<p>â€œNow is the judgment of this worldâ€ announces the decisive exposure and removal of the old orderâ€™s ruler.</p>
<h3>6) "Now is the Judgment of This World" Points to AD 70</h3>
<p>Jesus declares, "Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out" (v. 31). This is covenant lawsuit language. "This world" is not planet Earth or humanity in general â€” it is the old covenant order, the kosmos governed by the Law, the present evil age (Gal 1:4).</p>
<p>The judgment Jesus speaks of begins at the cross but is fully manifested in the destruction of Jerusalem. The cross defeats the accuser. The temple destruction removes his domain. Revelation 12:10-12 describes this same event: "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down."</p>
<p>Notice the timing in Revelation 12: "Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!" This describes the period between Christ's ascension and AD 70 â€” Satan's final, futile assault before his covenant authority is stripped away.</p>
<p>"This world" was judged when its center â€” the temple â€” was destroyed, its priesthood ended, its sacrifices ceased, and its covenant claims were publicly disproven. Jesus' death on the cross accomplished the legal victory. The events of AD 66-70 displayed that victory in history, casting the ruler of the old covenant age out of his place of accusation.</p>
<h3>7) Isaiah explains resistance</h3>
<p>Hardness is not failure of the mission but fulfillment of prophecy. The old covenant blindness precedes covenant renewal.</p>
<h3>8) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The lifting up of the Son through the cross initiates judgment and resurrection life, culminating in the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>Glory does not arrive through control or preservation, but through surrender. Life multiplies by being given away. The cross is not defeat â€” it is the doorway into the New Creation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>What might God be multiplying through what you are willing to release?</p>
