      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        The judgments are over. The Harlot is judged, the Beast is destroyed, Satan is cast into the lake of fire, and the Old Covenant realm of Death and Hades has been abolished. The old "heaven and earth" (the Mosaic covenantal world) has completely fled away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chapter 21 is the glorious climax of the Bible. It introduces the New Heaven and New Earth—not a brand new physical planet, but the entirely new, finalized covenantal order. Out of this new reality descends the New Jerusalem, which the angel explicitly identifies as the Bride of the Lamb. It is the Church, radiant and perfectly structured, where God's presence dwells permanently among humanity without the need for a physical temple.

      <div class="scripture-text">
        <span class="v-num">1</span> I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.<br />
        <span class="v-num">3</span> I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, God’s dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have passed away.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> He who sits on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” He said, “Write, for these words of God are faithful and true.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life.<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb’s bride.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,<br />
        <span class="v-num">11</span> having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;<br />
        <span class="v-num">12</span> having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> On the east were three gates; and on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates.<br />
        <span class="v-num">14</span> The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.<br />
        <span class="v-num">15</span> He who spoke with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.<br />
        <span class="v-num">16</span> The city is square, and its length is as great as its width. He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve stadia. Its length, width, and height are equal.<br />
        <span class="v-num">17</span> Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.<br />
        <span class="v-num">18</span> The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass.<br />
        <span class="v-num">19</span> The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;<br />
        <span class="v-num">20</span> the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.<br />
        <span class="v-num">21</span> The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.<br />
        <span class="v-num">22</span> I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.<br />
        <span class="v-num">23</span> The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.<br />
        <span class="v-num">24</span> The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.<br />
        <span class="v-num">25</span> Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there),<br />
        <span class="v-num">26</span> and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter.<br />
        <span class="v-num">27</span> There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not the End of the Planet:</strong> The "New Heaven and New Earth" is covenantal language drawn from Isaiah 65 and 66. When God established the Mosaic Law at Sinai, He called it planting the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth. In AD 70, that old system passed away, and the New Covenant order was fully established. Biological life on planet Earth continues, but the ruling covenant framework has permanently changed.</li>
        <li><strong>The City is the Bride (v. 9-10):</strong> The angel says, "I will show you the Bride." Then he shows John a <em>city</em>. The New Jerusalem is not a piece of futuristic celestial real estate; it is a stunning architectural metaphor for the Church.</li>
        <li><strong>Nations Walk in its Light (v. 24):</strong> If this chapter describes a perfect, sinless, post-resurrection planet where all evil has been eradicated, then who are the "kings of the earth" bringing their glory into it? The New Jerusalem exists <em>now</em>, on this present earth, serving as a beacon of light to the surrounding nations so they can enter through its continually open gates.</li>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>the sea is no more</strong> — In the ancient world, the sea represented chaos, separation, and the boundary of the Gentile nations. In the New Creation, the barrier between Jew and Gentile is completely removed, and the chaos of the Old Covenant system is gone.</li>
        <li><strong>twelve gates / twelve foundations</strong> — The city incorporates the twelve tribes of Israel (the gates) and the twelve apostles of the Lamb (the foundations). The Old and New Testaments are perfectly unified into one single covenantal house.</li>
        <li><strong>measured as a cube</strong> — The city is described as a perfect cube (length, width, and height are equal). In the Old Testament, the only perfect cube was the Holy of Holies inside the Temple. The implication is staggering: the entire New Covenant Church is the Holy of Holies.</li>
        <li><strong>no temple in it</strong> — The ultimate proof that the physical temple system is obsolete. God does not dwell in buildings made by hands; He dwells directly with His people.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The New Heaven and New Earth (vv. 1–4)</h3>
      <p>
        The passing of the "first heaven and the first earth" is often misunderstood as the incineration of the physical universe. However, in biblical theology, "heaven and earth" is frequently used to describe a covenantal world-order. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When Jesus said, "Until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota... will pass from the Law" (Matt 5:18), He was linking the duration of the Mosaic Law to the duration of that specific heaven and earth. When the temple fell in AD 70, the Old Covenant world ended. God made "all things new" by establishing the New Covenant. In this new reality, covenantal death (separation from God) is no more, and the mourning of the Old Covenant exile is wiped away. God dwells intimately with His people.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Bride is the City (vv. 9–14)</h3>
      <p>
        Futurists often search the skies for a literal golden cube measuring 1,500 miles wide to descend upon the Middle East. But John is looking at apocalyptic symbolism. The angel says, "Come, I will show you the Bride." He then shows John the city. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The city is the Church. Paul explicitly taught this in Ephesians 2, saying believers are "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple." John is seeing the completed, glorious spiritual reality of what Paul described. The Bride is radiant, secure, and built upon the unified testimony of the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Dimensions of Perfection (vv. 15–21)</h3>
      <p>
        The measurements of the city are entirely symbolic. The city is 12,000 stadia in length, width, and height. The wall is 144 cubits. These are multiples of 12 (the number of covenantal fullness). 
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly, the city is a perfect cube. In the ancient temple, only the Holy of Holies (where the presence of God dwelt) was a perfect cube. Under the Old Covenant, only one man (the High Priest) could enter the cube one day a year. In the New Creation, the <em>entire city</em> is the cube. Every single believer has total, unhindered access to the immediate presence of God.
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Open Gates and the Nations (vv. 22–27)</h3>
      <p>
        This section definitively proves that the New Jerusalem is a present, ongoing reality on earth today, not a future utopian planet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If this chapter describes the end of physical time where all sinners are in the lake of fire, who is living outside the city? Why do the gates need to remain open so that the "kings of the earth" can bring their glory into it? Why is there still a warning that the profane and the liars cannot enter (v. 27)?
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is that the New Jerusalem is the Church operating in the world today. Outside the gates, the world continues with its nations, kings, and unconverted people. But the gates of the Gospel are thrown wide open. The Church shines the light of Christ into the darkness, inviting the nations to leave their idolatry, wash their robes, and enter the covenant city.

        You are not waiting for a city to fall from the sky. You are a living stone in that city right now. The first heaven and earth (the Old Covenant of rules and condemnation) has completely passed away, and God is dwelling with you today. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> Because the New Jerusalem is established, you have permanent access to the Holy of Holies. The gates are open, the light is shining, and you are invited to bring the glory of Christ to the nations around you.
