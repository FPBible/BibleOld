<h1>1 Corinthians 1</h1>
<h2>One Christ · One Body · The End of Boasting</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase (1 Corinthians 1)</h2>

<p><strong>1:1–3</strong> Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, to the assembly of God in Corinth—those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called as holy ones—together with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place. Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>1:4–9</strong> I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus, that in Him you were enriched in every way—in speech and knowledge—so that you are not lacking in any gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will sustain you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with His Son.</p>

<p><strong>1:10–13</strong> I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and judgment. For it has been reported to me that there are quarrels among you. Each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” “I belong to Apollos,” “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.” Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?</p>

<p><strong>1:14–17</strong> I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one may say you were baptized in my name. Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel—not with clever speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be emptied of its power.</p>

<p><strong>1:18–25</strong> The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. God has made the wisdom of the world foolish. Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified—offensive to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, yet to those who are called, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</p>

<p><strong>1:26–31</strong> Consider your calling, brothers and sisters: not many were wise by worldly standards, powerful, or of noble birth. God chose what the world considers foolish to shame the wise; God chose what is weak to shame the strong. He chose what is low and despised—things that are not—to bring to nothing things that are, so that no one may boast before God. Because of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Therefore, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>
<p>
The Corinthian assembly is fractured by status, personalities, and allegiance groups.
Paul confronts this immediately, not by issuing rules,
but by re-centering everything on Christ and the cross.
Division is treated as a denial of New Covenant identity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Covenant / New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) Sanctified before corrected</h3>
<p>
Paul addresses them as already sanctified in Christ
before he addresses any failure.
Identity precedes behaviour.
Correction flows from who they are, not who they should become.
</p>

<h3>2) Factionalism is old-world thinking</h3>
<p>
Aligning under personalities mirrors the world’s hierarchy systems.
In the New Creation, no human mediator replaces Christ.
The moment allegiance shifts, the body fractures.
</p>

<h3>3) The cross dismantles status</h3>
<p>
The cross is not merely about forgiveness.
It is the end of human boasting.
Every system built on intelligence, power, lineage, or reputation
collapses at the cross.
</p>

<h3>4) Wisdom language exposes a world-transition</h3>
<p>
“Wisdom of this world” is not generic intelligence.
It is the operating logic of the old order.
God’s wisdom appears foolish because it dismantles the systems
people use to secure identity.
</p>

<h3>5) “Those who are perishing” vs “being saved”</h3>
<p>
This is covenantal movement language.
One order is passing away; another is coming into view.
Paul is describing transition, not eternal geography.

<h2>Key Idioms & Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Wisdom of the world”</strong> — Covenant and cultural systems of status and control.</li>
  <li><strong>“Perishing / being saved”</strong> — Transition language between covenant worlds.</li>
  <li><strong>“Boasting”</strong> — Claiming identity from anything other than Christ.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
1 Corinthians 1 strips away every substitute identity.
You do not belong because of your insight, maturity, or alignment.
You belong because you are in Christ.
Where Christ alone is the ground,
division loses its fuel and community becomes whole.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be drawing identity from something other than Christ?
