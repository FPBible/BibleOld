<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.<br/>
It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.<br/>
The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, â€œLord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.â€<br/>
But when Jesus heard it, he said, â€œThis sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that Godâ€™s Son may be glorified by it.â€<br/>
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.<br/>
When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.<br/>
Then after this he said to the disciples, â€œLetâ€™s go into Judea again.â€<br/>
The disciples asked him, â€œRabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you. Are you going there again?â€<br/>
Jesus answered, â€œArenâ€™t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesnâ€™t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.<br/>
But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isnâ€™t in him.â€<br/>
He said these things, and after that, he said to them, â€œOur friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.â€<br/>
The disciples therefore said, â€œLord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.â€<br/>
Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.<br/>
So Jesus said to them plainly then, â€œLazarus is dead.<br/>
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, letâ€™s go to him.â€<br/>
Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, â€œLetâ€™s go also, that we may die with him.â€<br/>
So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.<br/>
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.<br/>
Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.<br/>
Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.<br/>
Therefore Martha said to Jesus, â€œLord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldnâ€™t have died.<br/>
Even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.â€<br/>
Jesus said to her, â€œYour brother will rise again.â€<br/>
Martha said to him, â€œI know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.â€<br/>
Jesus said to her, â€œI am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.<br/>
Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?â€<br/>
She said to him, â€œYes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, Godâ€™s Son, he who comes into the world.â€<br/>
When she had said this, she went away and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, â€œThe Teacher is here and is calling you.â€<br/>
When she heard this, she arose quickly and went to him.<br/>
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.<br/>
Then the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, â€œShe is going to the tomb to weep there.â€<br/>
Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, â€œLord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldnâ€™t have died.â€<br/>
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,<br/>
and said, â€œWhere have you laid him?â€<br/>
They told him, â€œLord, come and see.â€<br/>
Jesus wept.<br/>
The Jews therefore said, â€œSee how much affection he had for him!â€<br/>
Some of them said, â€œCouldnâ€™t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?â€<br/>
Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.<br/>
Jesus said, â€œTake away the stone.â€<br/>
Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, â€œLord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.â€<br/>
Jesus said to her, â€œDidnâ€™t I tell you that if you believed, you would see Godâ€™s glory?â€<br/>
So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, â€œFather, I thank you that you listened to me.<br/>
I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.â€<br/>
When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, â€œLazarus, come out!â€<br/>
He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.<br/>
Jesus said to them, â€œFree him, and let him go.â€<br/>
Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him.<br/>
But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.<br/>
The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, â€œWhat are we doing? For this man does many signs.<br/>
If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.â€<br/>
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, â€œYou know nothing at all,<br/>
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.â€<br/>
Now he didnâ€™t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,<br/>
and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.<br/>
So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.<br/>
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.<br/>
Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.<br/>
Then they sought for Jesus and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, â€œWhat do you thinkâ€”that he isnâ€™t coming to the feast at all?â€<br/>
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Disciples, grieving Jews, and Israelâ€™s leadership</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> Resurrection language is brought into the present as a sign that covenant death is about to be overturned</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> This sign forces a decision: life in the Son, or preservation of a dying system.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) Lazarus represents Israel in covenant death</h3>
<p>Four days in the tomb emphasizes finality. Lazarus embodies a people beyond self-recovery, trapped in death under the Law.</p>
<h3>2) Delay is deliberate</h3>
<p>Jesus allows the situation to become humanly irreversible so the sign cannot be minimized. Resurrection will not be mistaken for recovery.</p>
<h3>3) What ended</h3>
<p>Future-only resurrection hope, Law-based identity, and temple-centered mediation of life are exposed as insufficient.</p>
<h3>4) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Resurrection is no longer an event on a calendar; it is a Person. Life now flows from union with the Son.</p>
<h3>5) â€œI am the resurrectionâ€ is covenant present tense</h3>
<p>Jesus does not point Martha forward in time â€” He points her to Himself. Resurrection life is standing in front of her.</p>
<h3>6) The unbinding is critical</h3>
<p>Lazarus is alive before he is unbound. Life comes first; freedom follows. This mirrors Israel being raised and then released from death-structures.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This sign accelerates the final conflict. Resurrection life confronts the old order, leading directly to the cross and culminating in the removal of the temple system in AD 70.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>Resurrection is not something you wait for â€” it is Someone you live in. Life has already spoken your name. Freedom is learning to walk unbound.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Where might God already have given life, while you are still waiting for the stone to move?</p>
