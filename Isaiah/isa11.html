      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of Isaiah 10, God describes His judgment on the proud Assyrian empire using the imagery of a mighty forester chopping down massive, towering trees. In stark contrast, Isaiah 11 opens by focusing on the royal house of David (the son of Jesse). By the time the Messiah arrives, the Davidic dynasty will not look like a towering cedar; it will look like a dead, forgotten stump. Yet, from this seemingly lifeless stump, a single Branch will spring up. This chapter prophesies the arrival of Jesus Christ, His endowment with the Holy Spirit, and the establishment of a "peaceable kingdom" where historically bitter enemies—often depicted in prophetic literature as predatory beasts and defenseless livestock—will dwell together in unprecedented unity.

        <span class="v-num">3</span> His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh. He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing of his ears;<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.<br />

        <span class="v-num">6</span> The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together; and a little child will lead them.<br />

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Branch:</strong> Fulfilled directly in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who descended from the line of David (Jesse's son), despite the royal dynasty having lost all political power centuries prior.</li>
        <li><strong>The Spirit's Rest:</strong> Fulfilled at the baptism of Christ, where the Holy Spirit descended and remained upon Him (John 1:32).</li>
        <li><strong>The Wolf and the Lamb:</strong> This is a prophetic idiom for the end of bitter ethnic and covenantal hostility (specifically between Jew and Gentile), fulfilled by the tearing down of the dividing wall in Ephesians 2.</li>
        <li><strong>The Banner to the Nations:</strong> The Apostle Paul explicitly quotes verse 10 in Romans 15:12 to prove that the inclusion of the Gentiles in the first-century church <em>was</em> the fulfillment of this prophecy.</li>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>stock of Jesse</strong> — Jesse was King David's father. Calling it the "stock" or "stump" implies the royal tree had been chopped down (the Babylonian exile ended the active Davidic throne).</li>
        <li><strong>breath of his lips</strong> — The spoken word of the Messiah brings judgment. This imagery is utilized in 2 Thessalonians 2:8 and Revelation 19 to describe Christ's victory over lawlessness.</li>
        <li><strong>my holy mountain</strong> — Mount Zion, representing the New Covenant Kingdom and the Church (Hebrews 12:22), not a literal mountain range.</li>
        <li><strong>banner of the peoples</strong> — A military rallying point. Christ crucified and resurrected is the standard around which the global Church gathers.</li>
        <li><strong>highway for the remnant</strong> — Prophetic imagery of a "Second Exodus." God creates a spiritual path for His people to escape the bondage of sin and the Old Covenant, just as He parted the Red Sea for ancient Israel.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) Life from a Dead Stump (vv. 1–5)</h3>
      <p>
        The Davidic dynasty ruled in Jerusalem for four hundred years, but in 586 BC, Babylon chopped the tree down. The kings were exiled, blinded, or killed. By the time of the first century, the royal line of Jesse was a forgotten, powerless stump; a carpenter in Nazareth named Joseph was one of its obscure heirs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, Isaiah prophesies that the ultimate King will not arise during the height of the dynasty's political power, but from its lowest point. The "shoot" is Jesus. Unlike the corrupt kings of Judah who relied on military alliances, this King is empowered entirely by the sevenfold Spirit of Yahweh (v. 2). He does not judge by outward appearance or political optics, but strikes the wicked with the truth of His word.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Peaceable Kingdom: Wolves and Lambs (vv. 6–9)</h3>
      
      <p>
        Verses 6 through 9 contain some of the most famous imagery in the Bible: the wolf living with the lamb, the leopard with the goat, and the lion eating straw like an ox. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Futurists read this as a literal, biological change to the digestive tracts of predatory animals that will supposedly occur during a future 1,000-year millennium. But this fundamentally misunderstands Hebrew prophetic idiom. Throughout the Old Testament, animals are constantly used as metaphors for nations and people groups.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Israel is repeatedly called God's "sheep" or "flock" (Psalm 79:13, Jeremiah 50:17).</li>
        <li>Gentile empires and hostile nations are repeatedly called lions, wolves, bears, and leopards (Ezekiel 22:27, Daniel 7, Jeremiah 5:6).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the ancient world, the Jew and the Gentile were natural enemies. The Gentile "wolves" historically devoured the Israelite "lambs." What Isaiah is prophesying is a breathtaking covenantal miracle: under the reign of the Branch, the historic, predatory hostility between nations will end. They will sit down at the same table. They will dwell in the same "holy mountain" (the Church) without hurting or destroying one another. The venomous bite of hatred will be removed.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Apostolic Proof of Fulfillment (v. 10)</h3>
      <p>
        We do not have to guess if this interpretation is correct. We have direct, inspired, apostolic commentary. In Romans 15, the Apostle Paul is writing to a church struggling with unity between Jewish and Gentile believers. To prove that God's plan was always to unite them into one family, Paul quotes a series of Old Testament texts. His final, climactic proof text is Isaiah 11:10.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "And again, Isaiah says, 'There will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope.'" (Romans 15:12)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Paul does not say, "Thousands of years from now, during a future millennium, the root of Jesse will finally unite people." He quotes Isaiah 11 to explain <em>what was actively happening in his first-century ministry.</em> The "wolf and lamb" peace was being fulfilled right then and there in the house churches of Rome, as historic enemies broke bread together under the banner of Christ.
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Second Exodus and the Gathering (vv. 11–16)</h3>
      
      <p>
        The remainder of the chapter speaks of a great ingathering. God promises to set His hand a "second time" to recover the remnant of His people from the nations. He uses the imagery of the first Exodus—drying up the tongue of the Egyptian sea and making a highway—to describe this new deliverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the ingathering of the true, spiritual Israel (the faithful remnant) and the calling of the Gentiles into the New Covenant. The old internal civil war between the northern kingdom (Ephraim) and the southern kingdom (Judah) is healed (v. 13). They are no longer defined by geographic borders or physical enemies (Philistines, Edomites); they march together on the "highway" of holiness into the Kingdom of God.
      </p>

      <h3>5) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        If we force a wooden, literalistic framework onto this poetry, we rob the Gospel of its power.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This chapter is <strong>not</strong> a promise of a future petting zoo where children can safely play with literal cobras.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> predicting a biological restructuring of the animal kingdom's food chain.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> an unfulfilled prophecy waiting for a future geopolitical Jewish state to conquer its modern Middle Eastern neighbors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To reduce Isaiah's majestic vision of covenant reconciliation to zoological trivia is to profoundly miss the point of the text.</p>

      <h3>6) The Covenant Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        The resolution of Isaiah 11 is the triumph of the Gospel of Peace. The Branch has grown. The Spirit has been poured out. The banner has been raised on the cross. And the ancient, bitter dividing wall of hostility that turned men into predatory beasts has been torn down. The New Covenant Church is the peaceable kingdom, where the earth is being filled with the knowledge of Yahweh as the waters cover the sea.

      <p>
        You are currently living in the peaceable kingdom of Isaiah 11. You do not have to wait for a future dispensation to experience the end of hostility. Because you are in Christ, the divisions of race, status, and background have been completely abolished (Galatians 3:28). The predatory nature of the flesh has been replaced by the Spirit of wisdom and fear of the Lord. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> Rest under the banner of the Root of Jesse.

      <h2>10. Apostolic Fulfillment Evidence</h2>
      <p>The New Testament writers viewed Isaiah 11 as a present, active reality, not a postponed dream:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pentecost (AD 30):</strong> The "knowledge of Yahweh" began to rapidly fill the earth as the Spirit was poured out and the Gospel went to the nations.</li>
        <li><strong>The inclusion of Cornelius (Acts 10):</strong> The moment a Roman Centurion (a literal "wolf" of the occupying empire) was baptized and sat at the table with Jewish believers (the "lambs"), Isaiah 11 was tangibly manifested in history.</li>
        <li><strong>The Epistles:</strong> The entire pastoral project of the Apostle Paul was ensuring that this newly forged unity in the "holy mountain" was maintained, proving the banner to the nations had already been raised.</li>
