      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        After exposing the absolute powerlessness of man-made idols in chapter 41, God dramatically shifts the focus to the ultimate agent of His redemptive plan: "My Servant." This chapter contains the first of Isaiah's four famous "Servant Songs" (the others being found in chapters 49, 50, and 52-53). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The ancient Jewish expectation was for a militaristic, conquering king who would violently overthrow Gentile empires. Instead, God presents a Servant who is characterized by profound gentleness—He won't even snap a bruised reed or extinguish a flickering wick. Yet, this gentle Servant will successfully establish justice throughout the entire world. The chapter concludes with a stark contrast between the faithful Servant (Christ) and the blind, deaf servant (the apostate nation of Israel under the Old Covenant).

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Servant Identity:</strong> Matthew 12:15-21 quotes Isaiah 42:1-4 verbatim, explicitly applying it to Jesus Christ's earthly ministry of healing and His refusal to provoke a violent political uprising.</li>
        <li><strong>A Covenant for the People:</strong> Jesus did not merely <em>deliver</em> a new covenant; He <em>is</em> the New Covenant (v. 6), embodying the fulfillment of the Law in Himself.</li>
        <li><strong>Light to the Nations:</strong> Fulfilled by the inclusion of the Gentiles into the Kingdom, breaking the ethnic boundaries of the Old Covenant system (Acts 26:23).</li>
        <li><strong>The Two Servants:</strong> The chapter contrasts the faithful Servant-Son (Christ) who brings light, with the blind, deaf servant-nation (Old Covenant Israel) who refuses to see the time of their visitation.</li>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>my soul delights</strong> — Echoed by the Father's voice at the baptism and transfiguration of Jesus: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (Matt 3:17).</li>
        <li><strong>bruised reed / dimly burning wick</strong> — Metaphors for the weak, the broken, and the spiritually exhausted. The Servant does not crush the weak; He restores them.</li>
        <li><strong>islands will wait for his law</strong> — "Islands" (or coastlands) represents the farthest reaches of the Gentile world. His rule is global, not localized to the Middle East.</li>
        <li><strong>new song</strong> — The response of the New Creation. The Old Covenant song was bound to the Levitical choir in Jerusalem; the New Covenant song is sung from "the end of the earth."</li>
        <li><strong>snared in holes / hidden in prisons</strong> — Covenantal language for exile and spiritual death. Israel under the Law was trapped in condemnation until the true Servant arrived to deliver them.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Apostolic Proof of the Servant (vv. 1–4)</h3>
      <p>
        We do not have to speculate about the identity of the Servant. In Matthew 12, Jesus heals a multitude of people, but strictly warns them not to make Him publicly known. Matthew explains that Jesus did this <em>specifically</em> to fulfill Isaiah 42:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: 'Behold, my servant whom I have chosen... He will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets. He won't break a bruised reed... until he leads justice to victory.'" (Matthew 12:17-20)
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        The first-century Jews expected a Zealot Messiah—a warrior who would shout in the streets, rally an army, and violently crush the Roman occupation. When Jesus arrived, He completely subverted that carnal expectation. His conquest was not geopolitical; it was spiritual. He brought the "justice" of God's grace to the marginalized, the sick, and the broken (the bruised reeds), conquering the true enemy: sin and death.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Servant IS the Covenant (v. 6)</h3>
      <p>
        God declares to the Servant: "I... will make you a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the Old Testament, the covenant was a written document (the Law on stone tablets) mediated by priests. But Isaiah prophesies a profound shift: the New Covenant is a <strong>Person</strong>. Jesus does not just bring a new set of rules; His very life, death, and resurrection constitute the covenant. To be "in Christ" is to be inside the New Covenant. Because the covenant is a Person rather than a geographic temple system, it can function as a "light to the nations," illuminating the entire globe.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Opening the Blind Eyes (v. 7)</h3>
      <p>
        The Servant’s mission is to "open the blind eyes" and "bring the prisoner out from the dungeon." When Jesus stood in the synagogue in Nazareth (Luke 4), He declared that He was anointed to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While Jesus performed literal, physical miracles of giving sight to the blind, these were signs pointing to a deeper covenantal reality. The true "prison" was the condemnation of the Old Covenant Law and the realm of spiritual death. Jesus emptied that prison, bringing His people into the light of justification.
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Divine Warrior and the New Song (vv. 10–15)</h3>
      <p>
        Verses 10 through 15 present a startling contrast to the quiet, gentle Servant. Yahweh goes out "like a mighty man" and raises a "war cry" (v. 13). He promises to destroy mountains, dry up rivers, and pant like a woman in labor (v. 14-15).
      </p>
      <p>
        How does the gentle Servant coexist with the violent Divine Warrior? This is the dual nature of the first-century covenant transition. Through the cross and the Gospel, Christ gently saves the bruised reeds and gathers the nations. But against the proud, apostate, persecuting Old Covenant system that rejected Him, He comes as a Warrior in judgment. In AD 70, God's "restraint" ended. He leveled the "mountains" of the Jewish theocracy, destroying the temple and permanently removing the obsolete system. The result of this victory is the "new song" (v. 10) sung by the Gentile coastlands—the global worship of the New Creation Church.
      </p>

      <h3>5) The Blind Servant vs. The Faithful Servant (vv. 18–25)</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter ends with a tragic indictment. God looks at national Israel (who was originally called to be His servant) and says: "Who is blind, but my servant? Or who is as deaf as my messenger?" (v. 19).
      </p>
      <p>
        The physical nation of Israel had the Law, the Temple, and the prophets, but they were spiritually blind. They saw many things, but did not observe. Because they rejected the true Servant (Christ), God "poured the fierceness of his anger on him... and it caught him on fire all around" (v. 25). This perfectly previews the tragic end of the Mosaic age, where the apostate nation was burned in the fire of God's covenant wrath, while the faithful remnant was delivered by the true, obedient Servant.
      </p>

      <h3>6) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        To preserve the Gospel, we must keep this text anchored in its first-century fulfillment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This chapter is <strong>not</strong> predicting a future political leader who will reorganize the modern United Nations.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> a delayed prophecy waiting for a future millennial age. Matthew 12 explicitly confirms it was fulfilled in the first-century ministry of Christ.</li>
        <li>The "justice" mentioned here is <strong>not</strong> primarily modern socio-political legislation; it is the divine justice of justification by faith—making men right with God across all ethnic boundaries.</li>
      </ul>
