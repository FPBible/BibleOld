      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        After the agonizing suffering and vindication of the Servant in Isaiah 53, the prophet transitions into the glorious aftermath. Isaiah 61 announces the arrival of the ultimate "Jubilee." Under the Old Covenant Law (Leviticus 25), every fiftieth year was a Year of Jubilee: slaves were freed, debts were canceled, and ancestral property was returned. However, Israel chronically failed to observe this command, leading to systemic oppression and their eventual exile. Here, the Spirit-anointed Messiah steps forward to declare a final, permanent Jubilee—not just a cancellation of financial debt, but a total release from the spiritual captivity, shame, and condemnation of the Old Covenant order. This chapter defines the operating environment of the New Creation.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explicit Present Fulfillment:</strong> In Luke 4:18-21, Jesus stands in the synagogue, reads verses 1-2, and declares, "Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing." It is not a delayed, future millennium; it is the present reality established at His first coming.</li>
        <li><strong>The Year of Yahweh's Favor:</strong> The inauguration of the New Covenant—the ultimate Jubilee where the debt of sin and the curse of the Law were completely canceled.</li>
        <li><strong>Priests of Yahweh:</strong> Fulfilled in the New Covenant Church. As Peter declares in 1 Peter 2:9, believers are now the "royal priesthood" mediating God's presence to the world, rendering the Levitical priesthood obsolete.</li>
        <li><strong>The Robe of Righteousness:</strong> The believer is clothed in the imputed righteousness of Christ, rather than the filthy rags of their own Law-keeping (Isaiah 64:6).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me</strong> — The anointing of Jesus at the Jordan River, equipping Him for His earthly ministry.</li>
        <li><strong>liberty to the captives</strong> — Covenantal release. Israel was trapped under the condemnation of the Mosaic Law; Jesus provides the Exodus out of that spiritual prison.</li>
        <li><strong>day of vengeance of our God</strong> — The corresponding judgment against the apostate Old Covenant system. (Notice that Jesus stopped reading in Luke 4 <em>before</em> this phrase, indicating His earthly ministry was the "favor," while the "vengeance" would follow later in that generation, AD 70).</li>
        <li><strong>build the old wastes</strong> — Rebuilding the "fallen tent of David" (Amos 9) by constructing the spiritual house of the Church.</li>
        <li><strong>everlasting covenant</strong> — The New Covenant in Christ's blood, which can never be broken or replaced (Hebrews 13:20).</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Ultimate "Today" (vv. 1–2)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah 61 is one of the very few Old Testament prophecies where we are given the exact day and hour of its activation. In Luke 4, Jesus enters the synagogue in Nazareth, opens the scroll of Isaiah, and reads these exact words. When He finishes, He rolls up the scroll, sits down, and says: <em>"Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This destroys any theological framework that attempts to push the fulfillment of Isaiah 61 into a postponed, future millennial age. The "Year of Yahweh's favor" began with the ministry of Christ. The Jubilee of the New Covenant is a present, operating reality.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Jubilee: Release from Covenant Debt (v. 1)</h3>
      <p>
        The language of "good news to the humble," "liberty to the captives," and "release to the bound" is the vocabulary of the biblical Jubilee (Leviticus 25). But Jesus is not announcing mere economic reform or physical prison breaks (John the Baptist remained in prison and was executed). 
      </p>
      <p>
        He is announcing a <strong>covenantal Jubilee</strong>. The primary captor of the people was the condemnation of the Law. "The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law" (1 Cor 15:56). The people were bankrupt, unable to pay the debt of perfect obedience required by Moses. Jesus announces the complete cancellation of that debt. The prison doors of the Old Covenant are thrown open.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Great Exchange (v. 3)</h3>
            <p>
        The arrival of the Messiah triggers a massive, systemic reversal. God executes a great exchange for the faithful remnant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A garland of beauty <em>instead of</em> ashes.</li>
        <li>The oil of joy <em>instead of</em> mourning.</li>
        <li>The garment of praise <em>instead of</em> a heavy, fainting spirit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Under the weight of the Old Covenant, the people were mourning in exile and ashes. But the New Covenant completely transforms their identity. They become "trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh." Their righteousness is not manufactured by their own striving; they are planted and sustained by God Himself so that He gets the glory.
      </p>

      <h3>4) A New Identity: The Priesthood of All Believers (v. 6)</h3>
      <p>
        "But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh. Men will call you the ministers of our God." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the old system, the priesthood was strictly limited to the tribe of Levi. Everyone else was excluded from the inner courts. But the Jubilee shatters that restriction. The entire body of the redeemed—Jew and Gentile alike—are elevated to the status of priests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle Peter directly applies this to the first-century church: "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9). You do not need a human mediator in a physical building to access God anymore. You <em>are</em> the priest, and you carry the presence of God to the nations.
      </p>

      <h3>5) Clothed in Righteousness (v. 10)</h3>
      <p>
        "He has clothed me with the garments of salvation. He has covered me with the robe of righteousness."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the absolute bedrock of the Gospel of Grace. Righteousness is worn; it is not earned. You cannot weave this garment yourself; it must be placed upon you by the Bridegroom. This perfectly aligns with Paul's declaration in Philippians 3:9: "Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ." When God looks at the New Covenant believer, He does not see their failures; He sees the perfect, spotless robe of His Son.
      </p>

      <h3>6) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        We must avoid dragging this text down into carnal, materialistic interpretations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a promise of a future utopian society where Christians will literally eat the physical gold and silver of other nations (v. 6).</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> a mandate for a modern political revolution or a "social gospel" that equates salvation merely with economic equity. The poverty and captivity Jesus solved was primarily spiritual and covenantal.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> an unfulfilled prophecy waiting for a future dispensation. Jesus declared it fulfilled "today."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You do not have to wait for the Jubilee; you are living in it. The debt of your sin has been permanently canceled by the blood of the everlasting covenant. You have traded the heavy spirit of fear and performance for the garment of praise. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> You are a fully ordained priest of the Most High God, clothed entirely in the righteousness of Christ. Walk in the liberty He has proclaimed.
