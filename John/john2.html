  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 2 — Signs of the New Creation: Abundance and a New Temple</h2>

  <h3>The Wedding at Cana — Old Water, New Wine</h3>

  <p>
    On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee.
    Jesus’ mother was there, and Jesus and His disciples were also invited to the wedding
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:1–2)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no wine.”
    Jesus replied, “Woman, what does that have to do with Me? My hour hasn’t come yet”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:3–4)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet even here, before His “hour,” He begins to reveal what the New Creation looks like.
    His mother told the servants, “Whatever He tells you, do it”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:5)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now there were six stone water jars there, used for the Jews’ ceremonial washing —
    physical symbols of the old covenant’s external purification system
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.”
    So they filled them to the brim.
    Then He said, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.”
    So they took it
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:7–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine,
    he didn’t know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew).
    He called the bridegroom and said,
    “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely,
    then the cheaper wine; but you have kept the good wine until now”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:9–10)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fulfilled language: the old covenant wine has run out.
    The New Covenant wine is better, richer, and it has arrived <strong>now</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This, the first of His signs, Jesus did in Cana of Galilee.
    He revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:11)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After this He went down to Capernaum with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples,
    and they stayed there a few days
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:12)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Clearing the Temple — Announcing the End of the Old Order</h3>

  <p>
    The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:13)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the temple courts He found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves,
    and money changers sitting there.
    Making a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple —
    with the sheep and the oxen.
    He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:14–15)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He said to those who sold doves,
    “Take these things away! Don’t make My Father’s house a marketplace!”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:16)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    His disciples remembered that it is written,
    “Zeal for Your house will consume Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA69.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ps 69:9)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:17)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the Jews said to Him, “What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:19)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jews replied, “It took forty-six years to build this temple,
    and will You raise it up in three days?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:20)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But He was speaking about the temple of His body
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:21)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this,
    and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:22)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fulfilled terms: the physical temple was doomed.
    The true Temple — Christ and His body — would stand forever
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Eph 2:21–22)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Shallow Belief and Real Knowing</h3>

  <p>
    While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival,
    many believed in His name when they saw the signs He was doing
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:23)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all people.
    He did not need anyone to testify about humanity,
    for He Himself knew what was in each person
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:24–25)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He saw the old heart clearly, and He had come to give the new one
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EZK36.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ezk 36:26–27)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 2</h2>

  <h3>1. Water to wine = Old Covenant to New Covenant</h3>
  <p>
    The six stone water jars are not an incidental detail.
    They are used for Jewish ceremonial washings —
    the external purification rituals of the old covenant system
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:6)</a>.
    Jesus doesn’t refill them with fresh water; He transforms the water into wine.
    Symbolically, the old order of outward washings is being replaced by the inward joy and fullness
    of the New Covenant
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JER31.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jer 31:33)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EZK36.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ezk 36:26–27)</a>.
    This is New Creation abundance: not a patch on the old, but a better, richer reality altogether.
  </p>

  <h3>2. “You kept the good wine until now” is a now-statement, not future hype</h3>
  <p>
    The master of the feast doesn’t realise it, but his words preach fulfilled eschatology:
    “You have kept the good wine until now”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:10)</a>.
    The best is not reserved for some distant age.
    In Christ, the “good wine” of the kingdom has already arrived.
    The New Creation is not a future upgrade to this world; it is the present, Spirit-filled reality
    of life in Christ’s finished work.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The first sign reveals His glory as New Creation King</h3>
  <p>
    John calls this miracle a “sign,” not just a miracle
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:11)</a>.
    It points beyond itself.
    By turning old covenant water into New Covenant wine, Jesus reveals His glory
    — the same glory John wrote about in chapter 1
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN01.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 1:14)</a>.
    He is the King who doesn’t merely repair the old system; He inaugurates an entirely new order.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Temple cleansing is prophetic judgment on the whole system</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus driving out the traders is not just Him being angry at “worldliness in church.”
    It is a prophetic sign-act announcing judgment on the temple system itself
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JER07.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jer 7:11)</a>.
    The temple has become a marketplace and a national-religious machine,
    and Jesus is declaring: this entire way of relating to God is coming down.
    In the fulfilled lens, this isn’t an isolated moral lesson — it is the unveiling of the end of the old
    covenant temple order.
  </p>

  <h3>5. “Destroy this temple… I will raise it” = transfer of God’s dwelling</h3>
  <p>
    When Jesus says, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:19)</a>,
    He is speaking about the temple of His body
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:21)</a>.
    His death and resurrection mark the definitive transfer of God’s dwelling place:
    from a stone temple in Jerusalem
    to the risen Christ Himself,
    and then to His people as His body
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Eph 2:21–22)</a>.
    The destruction of the physical temple in 70 AD is the historical confirmation
    that the old house is gone and the new house — the New Creation community — stands.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Jesus doesn’t trust sign-chasers; He knows the old heart</h3>
  <p>
    Many “believed” in His name when they saw the signs
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:23)</a>,
    but Jesus did not entrust Himself to them
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN02.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 2:24–25)</a>.
    He knows what is in the human heart shaped by the old world — attracted to power,
    spectacle, and religion, but resistant to deep transformation.
    The New Creation will not be built on shallow, sign-based enthusiasm;
    it will be built on people who receive a new heart and Spirit
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EZK36.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ezk 36:26–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 2 continues the same message as John 1:
    the old is not being polished; it is being replaced.
    The New Creation is already here in Christ,
    overflowing like new wine and centered in the true Temple — His body.
