<h2>Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
When Jesus finished instructing His twelve disciples, He moved on from there
to teach and proclaim in their cities.
</p>

<p>
Now John, hearing in prison about the works of the Christ,
sent word through his disciples and asked,
“Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect another?”
</p>

<p>
Jesus answered,
“Go and tell John what you hear and see:
the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed,
the deaf hear, the dead are raised,
and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.
Blessed is the one who does not stumble over Me.”
</p>

<p>
As John’s disciples departed, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John:
“What did you go out into the wilderness to see?
A reed shaken by the wind?
If not, what did you go out to see?
A man dressed in fine clothes?
Those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ houses.”
</p>

<p>
“What then did you go out to see?
A prophet?
Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
This is he of whom it is written,
‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,
who will prepare Your way before You.’”
</p>

<p>
“Truly I tell you, among those born of women
no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist.
Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”
</p>

<p>
“From the days of John the Baptist until now,
the kingdom of heaven has been pressing forward,
and forceful ones are laying hold of it.
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to accept it,
he is Elijah who was to come.
Whoever has ears, let him hear.”
</p>

<p>
“But to what shall I compare this generation?
It is like children sitting in the marketplaces,
calling out to others,
‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;
we sang a lament, and you did not mourn.’”
</p>

<p>
“For John came neither eating nor drinking,
and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
The Son of Man came eating and drinking,
and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard,
a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’
Yet wisdom is vindicated by her works.”
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done,
because they did not repent.
</p>

<p>
“Woe to you, Chorazin!
Woe to you, Bethsaida!
For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
on the day of judgment than for you.”
</p>

<p>
“And you, Capernaum,
will you be exalted to heaven?
You will be brought down to Hades.
For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom,
it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you that it will be more tolerable
for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”
</p>

<p>
At that time Jesus said,
“I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that You have hidden these things from the wise and learned
and revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father, for this was Your gracious will.”
</p>

<p>
“All things have been handed over to Me by My Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”
</p>

<p>
“Come to Me, all who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me,
for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
and you will find rest for your souls.
For My yoke is easy,
and My burden is light.”
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>John marks the <b>hinge</b> between Law/Prophets and Kingdom fulfillment.</li>
  <li>“The Law and the Prophets prophesied until John” signals covenant transition.</li>
  <li>Judgment language is directed at <b>first-century Galilean cities</b>, not the modern world.</li>
  <li>“This generation” continues the covenant indictment theme.</li>
</ul>

<h2>End of the Law — Rest Replaces Burden</h2>
<p>
The invitation to “come to Me” is not generic comfort language.
It is covenant language.
Jesus contrasts His yoke with the burden imposed by the Law
and its interpretive traditions.
</p>

<p>
Rest here is not emotional relief but <b>jurisdictional rest</b> —
release from the covenant system that measured righteousness by performance,
lineage, and ritual obedience.
</p>

<p class="note">
The Law demanded labor but could not give rest.
Christ gives rest because He ends the Law’s authority
and replaces it with shared life in the Son.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Those who live in the New Creation are not trying to balance Law and grace.
They are not learning how to carry Sinai more gently.
They live from union with Christ,
where knowledge of God flows from relationship, not regulation.
</p>

<p>
Rest is not postponed.
It is entered when covenant pressure ends.
