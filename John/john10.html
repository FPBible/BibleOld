  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 10 — The True Shepherd and the One New Flock</h2>

  <h3>The Door and the Shepherd</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you:
    the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door,
    but climbs in another way, is a thief and a robber.
    But the one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
    To him the gatekeeper opens.
    The sheep hear his voice,
    and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
    When he has brought out all his own,
    he goes before them, and the sheep follow him,
    because they know his voice.
    They will not follow a stranger,
    but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers”

  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus told them this figure of speech,
    but they did not understand what He was saying to them
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN10.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 10:6)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>I Am the Door</h3>

  <p>
    So Jesus said again,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you:
    I am the door of the sheep.
    All who came before Me are thieves and robbers,
    but the sheep did not listen to them.
    I am the door.
    If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved,
    and will go in and out and find pasture.
    The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy.
    I came that they may have life,
    and have it abundantly”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN10.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 10:7–10)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>I Am the Good Shepherd</h3>

  <p>
    “I am the good shepherd.
    The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
    The hired hand, who is not a shepherd
    and does not own the sheep,
