<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Paul’s Message Was Not Performance (2:1–5)</h3>

<p>
When I came to you, brothers, I did not arrive with impressive speech
or philosophical skill, announcing God’s testimony as a performance.
</p>

<p>
I made a deliberate decision among you:
to know nothing except Jesus Christ —
and Him crucified.
</p>

<p>
I was with you in weakness, fear, and much trembling.
My speech and proclamation were not shaped by persuasive techniques,
but by the Spirit’s active demonstration of power,
</p>

<p>
so that your trust would not rest on human wisdom,
but on God’s power already at work.
</p>

<h3>God’s Wisdom Was Hidden — and Is Now Revealed (2:6–9)</h3>

<p>
We do speak wisdom — but not the wisdom of this age,
nor of the rulers of this age who are being brought to nothing.
</p>

<p>
Instead, we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery:
the wisdom God had prepared before the ages
for our glory —
</p>

<p>
a wisdom none of the rulers of this age understood.
If they had recognised it,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
</p>

<p>
As Scripture says:
“What no eye saw,
what no ear heard,
what never entered the human heart —
these God has now prepared for those who love Him.”
</p>

<h3>The Spirit Has Already Made This Known (2:10–13)</h3>

<p>
God has revealed these things to us through the Spirit.
The Spirit searches everything —
even the depths of God.
</p>

<p>
Just as no one knows a person’s thoughts
except the person’s own spirit,
so no one knows God’s thoughts
except God’s Spirit.
</p>

<p>
We have not received the spirit of the world,
but the Spirit who comes from God,
so that we may know what God has freely given us.
</p>

<p>
We speak about these things,
not with words taught by human wisdom,
but with words taught by the Spirit,
interpreting spiritual realities to those who live by the Spirit.
</p>

<h3>The Spiritual and the Natural Mind (2:14–16)</h3>

<p>
The natural person does not accept what comes from God’s Spirit.
To them it appears foolish,
and they cannot recognise it,
because it is spiritually discerned.
</p>

<p>
The spiritual person discerns everything,
yet is not subject to the world’s judgments.
</p>

<p>
“For who has known the mind of the Lord,
so as to instruct Him?”
But we already share the mind of Christ.
</p>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
After exposing factional pride in chapter 1,
Paul now dismantles the Corinthian obsession with rhetorical brilliance
and philosophical hierarchy.
The issue is not intelligence —
it is the **source of authority**.
Corinth wants prestige.
Paul insists on revelation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) God’s wisdom is no longer hidden</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks of “mystery” language (2:7),
but he immediately says it has now been revealed (2:10).
Paul speaks of this as present and active,
because Paul’s entire argument depends on revelation already given,
not information waiting to arrive later.
</p>

<h3>2) “Rulers of this age” are already collapsing</h3>
<p>
Paul describes the rulers of “this age” as those who are being brought to nothing (2:6).
This is covenant-age language,
not a prediction about the end of the universe.
Their authority was already exposed by the crucifixion itself.
</p>

<h3>3) “Prepared for our glory” is not postponed</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say glory will eventually come.
He speaks of wisdom prepared for “our glory” —
a shared participation in Christ’s life now revealed through the Spirit.
This wisdom belongs to that realised horizon.
</p>

<h3>4) Discernment is relational, not elitist</h3>
<p>
The “spiritual person” is not a superior class.
It simply describes someone participating in the Spirit’s life,
as opposed to operating from the old identity structures of the age that is passing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“This age” (2:6):</strong> covenant system and authority structure, not the physical cosmos.</li>
  <li><strong>“Mystery” (2:7):</strong> something once hidden but now revealed in Christ.</li>
  <li><strong>“Mind of Christ” (2:16):</strong> shared perception shaped by the cross, not private intuition.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
New Creation wisdom does not reward cleverness.
It reshapes perception.
To live by the Spirit is to see reality through the cross,
where power looks like self-giving love
and wisdom looks like humility.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still trusting impressive ideas or voices,
instead of living from what God has already revealed in Christ?
</p>
