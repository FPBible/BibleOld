<h1>Prophecy Hub</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Judgment · Covenant Transition · New Creation</h2>

<p>
Biblical prophecy does not describe the end of the physical universe.
It announces covenant judgment, the removal of an old religious order,
and the establishment of a new way of life in Christ.
</p>

<p>
This hub exists to show how Scripture itself uses prophetic language —
and how the New Testament declares its fulfilment.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How to Read This Hub</h2>

<p>
The prophets spoke in symbolic, poetic, and covenantal language.
Heaven and earth, sun and moon, clouds and fire, coming and shaking
are not modern scientific terms.
They describe authority, worship systems, judgment, and transition.
</p>

<p>
The New Testament does not reinterpret these symbols into something new.
It applies them — decisively — to the first-century transition
from the Old Covenant world to the New.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>I. Covenant Judgment Texts</h2>
<p>
These texts announce judgment on the Old Covenant system.
They are time-bound, audience-relevant, and fulfilled within history.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="matt24.html">Matthew 24 — Judgment on Jerusalem</a><br />
    Jesus interprets Israel’s prophetic tradition and announces the end of the temple world.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="luke21.html">Luke 21 — Days of Vengeance</a><br />
    Luke makes explicit that these events fall within that generation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="daniel.html">Daniel — Kingdom, Son of Man, and Time</a><br />
    The framework behind “coming,” authority, and kingdom language.
  </li>

  <li>

    Creation language used to describe covenant renewal and restoration.
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="psalms.html">Psalms — Enthronement and Rule</a><br />

  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="2peter3.html">2 Peter 3 — Heavens and Earth</a><br />

  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="revelation.html">Revelation — Symbol, Judgment, Victory</a><br />
    Apocalyptic imagery revealing judgment, vindication, and victory.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>II. Presence and “Coming” Clarified</h2>
<p>
These pages explain how Scripture uses “coming” language —
not as delayed physical travel, but as royal presence and exercised authority.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="son-of-man.html">Son of Man — Covenant Authority and Vindication</a><br />
    Daniel 7, enthronement, and how Jesus uses the title.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="1thess4.html">1 Thessalonians 4 — Presence, Not Escape</a><br />
    Comfort language rooted in resurrection hope, not evacuation theology.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>III. Resurrection Explained</h2>
<p>
These writings are interpretive, not predictive.
They explain what resurrection means in light of Christ’s finished work.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15 — Resurrection and Victory</a><br />
    Resurrection defined as the defeat of death and the completion of covenant transition.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>IV. Judgment, Satan, and Hell</h2>
<p>
These pages address commonly misunderstood terms
without importing later mythology or fear-based frameworks.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="satan.html">Satan — The Adversary in Covenant Context</a><br />
    “The satan” as accuser and opposer within Israel’s covenant story.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="hell.html">Hell — Origins and Meaning</a><br />
    Gehenna, Hades, and judgment language explained within Scripture’s own horizon.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Prophecy in Scripture is not about predicting the distant future.
It is about God setting things right —
judging what is corrupt,
vindicating what is faithful,
and establishing life in Christ.
</p>

<p>
The New Testament declares that this transition has occurred.
The invitation now is not to wait,
but to live within what has been fulfilled.
