<h1>Colossians 3</h1>
<h2>Put On the New Human · Life From Union · No Return to Shadows</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Set Your Mind on the Above (Col 3:1–4)</h2>

<p><strong>3:1–2</strong> If you were raised with Christ, then seek the things above — where Christ is, seated at God’s right hand. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things on the earth.</p>

<p><strong>3:3–4</strong> For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God. When Christ — who is your life — is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Put to Death the Old Pattern (Col 3:5–11)</h2>

<p><strong>3:5–7</strong> So put to death what belongs to the old way: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed — which is idolatry. Because of these things the wrath is coming. This is how you once walked, when you lived in them.</p>

<p><strong>3:8–9</strong> But now you must put them all away: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy speech. Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old human with its practices,</p>

<p><strong>3:10–11</strong> and you have put on the new human, being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the One who created him — where there is no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free — but Christ is all, and in all.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Put On Christlike Life (Col 3:12–17)</h2>

<p><strong>3:12–13</strong> Therefore, as God’s chosen ones — holy and loved — put on compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Bear with one another, and forgive each other — just as the Lord forgave you, so you also should forgive.</p>

<p><strong>3:14–15</strong> Above all these, put on love — which binds everything together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which you were also called in one body. And be thankful.</p>

<p><strong>3:16–17</strong> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and warning one another with all wisdom, with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. And whatever you do — in word or deed — do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Households: New Life in Ordinary Places (Col 3:18–25)</h2>

<p><strong>3:18–19</strong> Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.</p>

<p><strong>3:20–21</strong> Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they don’t lose heart.</p>

<p><strong>3:22–24</strong> Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything — not with eye-service as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. Whatever you do, work from the soul, as for the Lord and not for people, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.</p>

<p><strong>3:25</strong> For the wrongdoer will be repaid for the wrong done, and there is no partiality.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Colossians 3 is not a call to “try harder.”
It is Paul applying the reality of chapters 1–2:
you have been transferred, made full, and freed from shadow-judgment.
Now he says: live like it.
</p>

<p>
The engine is union:
<strong>you died; you were raised; Christ is your life.</strong>
So the old pattern is not your identity anymore.
Stop wearing it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) “Above” is not “go to heaven,” it’s “live from Christ’s reign”</h3>
<p>
Paul is not telling believers to escape the earth.
“Above” points to the realm of Christ’s authority and finished access.
It is a mindset rooted in His reign, not in shadow systems or fear-based living.
</p>

<h3>2) “You died” is covenant transfer language</h3>
<p>
This is not poetic self-help.
It is identity language: the old person defined by condemnation, accusation, and the former order has ended.
Your life is now hidden with Christ — secure, not fragile.
</p>

<h3>3) “Wrath is coming” is covenant-accounting language</h3>
<p>
Paul is not threatening random believers with end-of-the-world doom.
He is warning that the old world’s pattern of corruption and idolatry is under judgment.
In the first-century horizon, this aligns with the covenant crisis culminating in the end of the old order.
</p>

<h3>4) The “old human / new human” is the Bible’s anthropology of the ages</h3>
<p>
Paul frames humanity as two modes:
old humanity (Adamic, law-defined, divided, hostile)
and new humanity (Christic, reconciled, unified, renewed).
This is New Creation language: a new kind of human life is here.
</p>

<h3>5) “No Greek or Jew…” means identity markers lost authority</h3>
<p>
Paul is not erasing ethnicity or history.
He is declaring that covenant boundary markers no longer define belonging.
The old identity system collapses because Christ is now the definition of the people of God.
</p>

<h3>6) Holiness is “put on,” not “worked up”</h3>
<p>
Notice Paul’s logic:
you are already holy and loved (3:12).
Therefore, put on compassion, humility, patience, love.
This is not earning love; it is expressing what is already true.
</p>

<h3>7) “Let peace rule” is the opposite of religion</h3>
<p>
Religion often motivates with insecurity.
Paul commands peace to rule because the war is over.
Reconciliation is finished.
So the inner climate of the New Creation is not anxiety — it’s peace.
</p>

<h3>8) The household instructions bring New Creation into ordinary life</h3>
<p>
Paul doesn’t keep the New Creation in “spiritual” zones.
He pushes it into relationships, speech, work, and leadership.
Union is meant to be visible in the everyday.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>

<p>
Colossians 3 is what “renew the mind” looks like without religion.
You don’t become new by self-hate.
You become new by living from union:
Christ is your life.
</p>

<p>
So the question is not “How do I fix myself?”
It’s “What belongs to the old pattern — and why am I still wearing it?”
</p>

<p>
Then you put on what matches the New Human:
peace, love, forgiveness, steady speech, honest work, and dignity in relationships.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
What old pattern — anger, insecurity, impurity, image management, fear —
am I still treating as “me,” instead of putting it off as something that no longer owns me?
</p>
