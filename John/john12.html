<h1>John 12</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Anointing for Burial (John 12:1–11)</h2>

<p>Six days before Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived — the one He had raised from the dead. They prepared a meal for Him. Martha served, Lazarus reclined with Him, and Mary took a pound of costly perfume and anointed Jesus’ feet, wiping them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance.</p>

<p>Judas objected, claiming the perfume could have been sold and given to the poor. He said this not out of concern, but because he was a thief. Jesus replied that Mary had kept this for the day of His burial. The poor would remain, but He would not.</p>

<p>Many came to see Jesus and Lazarus. The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus as well, because many were believing because of him.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The King Enters (John 12:12–19)</h2>

<p>The next day, a large crowd went out to meet Jesus, waving palm branches and shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel!” Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, fulfilling what was written.</p>

<p>The disciples did not understand these things at first, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered. The crowd that had seen Lazarus raised testified openly, and the Pharisees admitted they were losing control.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Hour Has Come (John 12:20–36)</h2>

<p>Some Greeks asked to see Jesus. When told, Jesus said that the hour had come for the Son of Man to be glorified. He explained that unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone — but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</p>

<p>Jesus said that loving one’s life preserves it only temporarily, but losing it in this age leads to eternal life. He spoke of His coming death, saying He would be lifted up and draw all people to Himself.</p>

<p>A voice came from heaven affirming Him. Jesus said the voice was for the crowd. Judgment was now coming upon this world, and the ruler of this world would be cast out. The crowd struggled to reconcile this with their expectations.</p>

<p>Jesus urged them to walk in the light while they had it, so they would become children of light.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Israel’s Blindness Explained (John 12:37–50)</h2>

<p>Though Jesus had done many signs, many did not believe. John explains this through Isaiah: their eyes were blinded and hearts hardened.</p>

<p>Some leaders believed but feared exclusion from the synagogue, loving human approval more than God’s glory.</p>

<p>Jesus cried out that believing in Him was believing in the One who sent Him. He came as light so that no one believing in Him would remain in darkness. He said He did not come to judge the world, but that His word would judge on the last day.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, publicly in Jerusalem</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Israel at Passover, including leaders and the crowds</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The final public announcement that the old covenant world is ending and the New Creation is arriving through the cross</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> This chapter openly declares that death, judgment, kingship, and glory converge in the Son’s lifting up.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) The anointing confirms the hour</h3>
<p>Mary anoints Jesus for burial before the cross occurs. The transition is already set in motion. Resurrection life will come through covenant death.</p>

<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>Messianic expectations of political triumph, temple-centered glory, and preservation of the old order.</p>

<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Glory revealed through self-giving love, a kingdom established through death and resurrection, and a people gathered beyond Israel.</p>

<h3>4) Greeks signal covenant expansion</h3>
<p>The request from Greeks shows the scope of what is coming. The old boundary is dissolving; the harvest is about to multiply.</p>

<h3>5) Judgment is now</h3>
<p>“Now is the judgment of this world” announces the decisive exposure and removal of the old order’s ruler.</p>

<h3>6) Isaiah explains resistance</h3>
<p>Hardness is not failure of the mission but fulfillment of prophecy. The old covenant blindness precedes covenant renewal.</p>

<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The lifting up of the Son through the cross initiates judgment and resurrection life, culminating in the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>Glory does not arrive through control or preservation, but through surrender. Life multiplies by being given away. The cross is not defeat — it is the doorway into the New Creation.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>What might God be multiplying through what you are willing to release?</p>
