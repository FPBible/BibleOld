<h1>Revelation 22</h1>
<h2>The River of Life and the End of the Age</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV22.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 22 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 21 unveiled the New Covenant world: God dwelling with His people.
Revelation 22 closes the book by showing how that life flows,
how access remains open,
and how the message is sealed—not for delay,
but for immediacy.
This chapter is the resolution of the covenant story,
not an appendix about the distant future.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>The River and the Tree of Life (22:1–5)</h3>
<p>
A river of the water of life flows from the throne of God and the Lamb,
clear and abundant.
On both sides stands the tree of life,
bearing fruit continually,
with leaves for the healing of the nations.
</p>
<p>
There is no longer any curse.
God’s servants see His face,
bear His name,
and reign with Him.
Night is gone.
God Himself is their light.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>“These Words Are Faithful and True” (22:6–11)</h3>
<p>
The message is affirmed as trustworthy.
The time is near.
The words of this prophecy are not sealed,
because fulfillment is at hand.
</p>
<p>
Each person remains aligned with their chosen path.
Revelation is not about coercion,
but exposure and clarity.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> “Near,” “soon,” and “do not seal”
mean exactly what they say.
This chapter closes a first-century covenant transition,
not a 21st-century prediction.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>“I Am Coming Quickly” — Covenant Presence (22:12–16)</h3>
<p>
Christ declares His nearness.
He is the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the end.
</p>
<p>
Blessing belongs to those who live within this life,
who have access to the tree,
who enter the city openly.
Outsiders remain defined by allegiance to the former order.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Final Invitation and Warning (22:17–19)</h3>
<p>
The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.”
The invitation is open.
Life is freely given.
</p>
<p>
The warning guards the message.
This revelation must not be reshaped to delay,
distort,
or domesticate its meaning.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>“Surely I Am Coming Quickly” — The Final Word (22:20–21)</h3>
<p>
The book closes with expectation fulfilled,
not postponed.
Grace rests upon God’s people.
The covenant story is complete.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The river flows now, not later</h3>
<p>
Life flows from the throne continuously.
This is New Covenant supply,
not future access.
The imagery declares abundance,
not postponement.
</p>

<h3>2) The tree of life is restored access</h3>
<p>
What was barred in Genesis is restored in Christ.
Healing of the nations means covenant inclusion,
not medical imagery.
Access is permanent.
</p>

<h3>3) “No more curse” means covenant restoration</h3>
<p>
The curse belonged to the broken covenant world.
Its removal signals completion.
Condemnation has no authority here.
</p>

<h3>4) “Do not seal” demands urgency</h3>
<p>
Unlike Daniel,
this vision is not for a distant generation.
It demanded faithfulness and clarity from its first hearers—
and delivered exactly what it promised.
</p>

<h3>5) “Coming quickly” is covenant presence</h3>
<p>
This is not spatial travel language.
It is judicial and relational:
Christ acting decisively within their horizon.
He came in judgment and vindication.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation does not end with fear or delay.
It ends with access,
life,
light,
and invitation.
New Creation life is not awaited.
It is inhabited.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where do I still live as if access is limited or life is deferred?
What would change if I fully trusted
that the river flows now
and the invitation remains open?
</p>
