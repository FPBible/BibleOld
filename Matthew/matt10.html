<h2>Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Jesus called His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits,
to drive them out, and to heal every disease and sickness.
</p>

<p class="small">
The twelve were: Simon called Peter, Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee and John his brother;
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus;
Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.
</p>

<p>
Jesus sent them out with these instructions:
“Do not go to the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, proclaim, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out spirits.
Freely you received; freely give.”
</p>

<p>
“Take no gold or silver or copper in your belts,
no bag for the road, no extra tunic or sandals or staff,
for the worker is worthy of his food.
Whatever town or village you enter, find someone worthy and stay there until you leave.
As you enter the house, let your peace rest on it.
If the house is worthy, let your peace remain;
if not, let your peace return to you.”
</p>

<p>
“If anyone will not receive you or listen to your words,
shake the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah
on the day of judgment than for that town.”
</p>

<p>
“Behold, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves.
Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
They will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me,
as a testimony to them and to the nations.”
</p>

<p>
“When they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you will speak.
What you are to say will be given to you in that hour.
It is not you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.”
</p>

<p>
“Brother will deliver brother to death, and a father his child.
Children will rise against parents and have them put to death.
You will be hated by all because of My name,
but the one who endures to the end will be saved.”
</p>

<p>
“When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next.
For truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel
before the Son of Man comes.”
</p>

<p>
“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
If they called the master of the house Beelzebul,
how much more those of his household.
So do not fear them.
Nothing is covered that will not be revealed,
and nothing hidden that will not be known.”
</p>

<p>
“What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light.
What you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.
Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”
</p>

<p>
“Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?
Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father.
Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
So do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.”
</p>

<p>
“Everyone who acknowledges Me before others,
I will also acknowledge before My Father in heaven.
But whoever denies Me before others,
I will also deny before My Father in heaven.”
</p>

<p>
“Do not think that I came to bring peace to the land.
I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
For I came to turn a man against his father,
a daughter against her mother,
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
A person’s enemies will be members of his own household.”
</p>

<p>
“Whoever loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me.
Whoever loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
Whoever does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.”
</p>

<p>
“Whoever finds his life will lose it,
and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.”
</p>

<p>
“Whoever receives you receives Me,
and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
Whoever receives a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward,
and whoever receives a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.”
</p>

<p>
“And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones
because he is My disciple,
truly I tell you, he will by no means lose his reward.”
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The mission is explicitly limited to <b>Israel</b>, not the nations.</li>
  <li>Persecution language belongs to the <b>first-century covenant conflict</b>.</li>
  <li>“You will not finish the towns of Israel” fixes the timing before AD 70.</li>
  <li>“Son of Man comes” refers to covenant vindication, not global descent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
This chapter is not a template for modern missionary fear or family fracture.
It documents the pressure of covenant transition as the old order resisted its end.
The sword Jesus brings is not violence, but division caused by truth
during the collapse of the Mosaic world.
