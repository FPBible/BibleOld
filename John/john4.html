  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 4 — Living Water and the New Covenant Worship</h2>

  <h3>Jesus and the Samaritan Woman</h3>

  <p>
    When Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard He was making and baptising
    more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself didn't baptise, but His disciples did),
    He left Judea and departed again for Galilee.
    He needed to pass through Samaria
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:1–4)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar,
    near the piece of land Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
    Jacob’s well was there,
    and Jesus, tired from His journey, sat by the well.
    It was about the sixth hour
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:5–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Samaritan woman came to draw water.
    Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink”
    (His disciples had gone into town to buy food)
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:7–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Samaritan woman said,
    “How is it that You, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?”
    (Jews do not associate with Samaritans)
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:9)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered her,
    “If you knew the gift of God,
    and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’
    you would have asked Him,
    and He would have given you living water”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:10)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    She said, “Sir, You have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep.
    Where do You get that living water?
    Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:11–12)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered,
    “Everyone who drinks this water will thirst again,
    but whoever drinks the water I give will never thirst.
    The water I give will become a spring of water within them,
    welling up to eternal life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:13–14)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman said, “Sir, give me this water, so I won’t thirst
    or have to keep coming here to draw water”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:15)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Revealing the Heart</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.”
    She said, “I have no husband.”
    Jesus replied, “You’re right in saying you have no husband —
    you’ve had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband.
    What you’ve said is true”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:16–18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman said, “Sir, I see that You are a prophet.
    Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain,
    but you Jews say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:19–20)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The End of Location-Based Worship</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus said to her,
    “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming
    when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
    You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know,
    for salvation is from the Jews.
    But the hour is coming — and now is —
    when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth,
    for the Father seeks such people.
    God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:21–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman said, “I know that Messiah is coming.
    When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”
    Jesus replied, “I am He — the One speaking to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:25–26)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Disciples Return</h3>

  <p>
    Just then His disciples returned.
    They marveled that He was speaking with a woman,
    yet no one asked, “What do You want?” or “Why are You talking to her?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:27)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman left her water jar,
    went into the town, and said to the people,
    “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did.
    Could this be the Christ?”
    They went out of the town and came toward Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:28–30)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Food of the New Creation</h3>

  <p>
    Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”
    But He said, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”
    So the disciples said to one another, “Has someone brought Him food?”
    Jesus said, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me
    and to finish His work”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:31–34)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He continued,
    “Open your eyes and look at the fields — they are already white for harvest!
    The reaper receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life,
    so the sower and the reaper may rejoice together”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:35–36)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Harvest in Samaria</h3>

  <p>
    Many Samaritans from that town believed in Him
    because of the woman’s testimony:
    “He told me everything I ever did.”
    When they came to Him, they urged Him to stay with them,
    and He stayed two days.
    Many more believed because of His word
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:39–41)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said to the woman,
    “Now we believe not because of your testimony,
    but because we have heard Him ourselves,
    and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:42)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Healing of the Royal Official’s Son</h3>

  <p>
    After two days He departed for Galilee.
    Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
    When He came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him,
    having seen all He did in Jerusalem at the Feast
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:43–45)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He returned to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water wine.
    A royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee.
    He went to Him and begged Him to come heal his son, who was close to death
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:46–47)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”
    The official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”
    Jesus said to him,
    “Go your way; your son lives.”
    The man believed the word Jesus spoke and went home
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:48–50)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the way his servants met him, saying,
    “Your son lives!”
    He asked them when he began to recover.
    They said, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”
    The father realized this was the exact time Jesus had said, “Your son lives,”
    and he believed — he and his whole household
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:51–53)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was the second sign Jesus performed in Galilee
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:54)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 4</h2>

  <h3>1. Living water = the Spirit of the New Creation</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus contrasts Jacob’s well — tied to ancestry, land, and old covenant identity —
    with “living water,” the Spirit
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:13–14)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN07.htm#v37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 7:37–39)</a>.
    This is Ezekiel 36 fulfilled: the new heart and the new Spirit
    flowing as a spring within the believer.
    The Spirit is not a future promise; He is a present reality in the New Covenant.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Jesus reveals that worship is no longer tied to geography</h3>
  <p>
    The conversation about “this mountain vs Jerusalem”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:20)</a>
    is a conversation about the old covenant world.
    Jesus ends that debate:
    “The hour is coming — and now is — when true worshipers worship the Father
    in spirit and truth”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:23)</a>.
    Temple-based worship is about to vanish;
    Spirit-based worship is the permanent New Creation reality.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Jesus reveals Himself as Messiah — directly</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike with the Jewish leaders, Jesus openly tells the Samaritan woman,
    “I am He”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:26)</a>.
    This foreshadows the universal reach of the New Covenant:
    Samaritans — outsiders to the Jewish religious system — become early recipients of the revelation.
    The New Creation breaks ethnic and covenant boundaries.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The harvest is already ripe — the New Covenant is breaking in</h3>
  <p>
    “The fields are already white for harvest”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:35)</a>.
    Jesus is not predicting a future missionary age.
    He is declaring the readiness of Israel and Samaria in His own time.
    The new age is dawning; the kingdom is at hand; the harvest has begun.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Samaritans recognize Him as “Savior of the world”</h3>
  <p>
    In contrast to many in Israel, the Samaritans see clearly:
    “This is truly the Savior of the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:42)</a>.
    They become a prophetic sign that the New Covenant is not tribal but global.
    The old boundaries of ethnicity and land are dissolving in the New Creation.
  </p>

  <h3>6. The royal official’s son — sign of New Creation authority</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus heals from a distance by His word alone
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN04.htm#v50" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 4:50)</a>.
    This is royal authority, the authority of the enthroned Son.
    His word creates life — just as the Word created in the beginning
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN01.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 1:1–3)</a>.
    In the New Creation, His word still carries that life-giving power.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 4 shows the old covenant system fading,
    geography becoming irrelevant,
    the Spirit being given now,
    and Jesus revealing Himself as the Savior of the world in real time.
    Everything in this chapter pushes toward one truth:
    the New Creation is here, and Jesus is its source.
