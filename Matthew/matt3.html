  <h1>Matthew 3</h1>

  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <p>Matthew 3 marks the transition from the private life of Jesus to His public identification as the Messiah. The scene shifts to the wilderness, where John the Baptist appears as the final prophet of the Old Covenant age. This chapter establishes the "judgment and fire" motif that characterizes the end of the Mosaic age and the inauguration of the New Creation.</p>

  <h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>
  <div class="scripture-text">
    <span class="v-num">1</span>And in those days comes John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 
    <span class="v-num">2</span>and saying, “<strong>Repent, for the Kingdom of the Heavens has come near</strong>,” 
    <span class="v-num">3</span>for this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the LORD, make His paths straight.” 
    <span class="v-num">4</span>And this John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
    <span class="v-num">5</span>Then were going forth to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan, 
    <span class="v-num">6</span>and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins. 
    <span class="v-num">7</span>And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “<strong>Brood of vipers</strong>! Who warned you to flee from the <strong>coming wrath</strong>? 
    <span class="v-num">8</span>Yield, then, fruit worthy of the repentance, 
    <span class="v-num">9</span>and do not think to say in yourselves, We have a father—Abraham; for I say to you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 
    <span class="v-num">10</span>And <strong>already also the axe is laid to the root of the trees</strong>; every tree, then, not yielding good fruit is cut down and cast into fire. 
    <span class="v-num">11</span>I indeed baptize you in water to repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, He will baptize you in the <strong>Holy Spirit and fire</strong>, 
    <span class="v-num">12</span>whose <strong>winnowing shovel</strong> is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor, and will gather His wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.” 
    <span class="v-num">13</span>Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him, 
    <span class="v-num">14</span>but John was forbidding Him, saying, “I have need by You to be baptized—and You come to me?” 
    <span class="v-num">15</span>And Jesus answering said to him, “Permit now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness”; then he permits Him. 
    <span class="v-num">16</span>And having been baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him, 
    <span class="v-num">17</span>and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “<strong>This is My Son—the Beloved</strong>, in whom I did delight.”

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. Proximity of the Kingdom</h3>
  <p>The ministry of John the Baptist begins with a specific time-sensitive proclamation: "The Kingdom of the Heavens has come near". In the Full Preterist framework, this "nearness" (Greek: <i>engiken</i>) is an inspired declaration of objective, chronological imminence. John was not announcing a far-off spiritual realm; he was announcing that the transition from the Old Covenant age to the Messianic age was literally at the door. The Kingdom was "at hand" for that generation. This proximity required an immediate response of repentance, as the legal "passing away" of the old world was about to begin. The Kingdom is a present, settled reality—not a future hope. By AD 70, this Kingdom was fully manifested as the old "heaven and earth" of the Mosaic system were removed to make way for the spiritual, everlasting reign of Christ. We currently live in the "finished" state of this Kingdom, a reality that John saw as impending and ready to break through the veil of the Old Covenant.</p>

  <h3>2. Judgment and the Axe</h3>
  <p>John’s warning to the religious elite regarding the "coming wrath" is a direct reference to the impending destruction of Jerusalem. When he declares that the "axe is already laid to the root," he is emphasizing that the judgment process was a present legal reality. The trees represent the institutional structure of Israel under the Law. To be a "child of Abraham" by fleshly descent was no longer a shield against the legal requirements of the New Covenant. The "fire" John mentions is the specific, unquenchable fire of AD 70, which consumed the Temple. This judgment was the final "cutting down" of the Old Covenant tree. Full Preterism understands this "wrath" as the covenantal lawsuit of God against an apostate generation. It was the necessary removal of the old to allow the New Creation to stand without competition. The axe was aimed at the root of the Mosaic system that refused to bear fruit in the Light of the Messiah.</p>

  <h3>3. The Winnowing and the Coronation</h3>
  <p>The imagery of the "winnowing shovel" describes the sorting process that occurred during the "last days" of the Old Covenant (AD 30–70). Jesus came to cleanse His floor—corporate Israel. The "wheat" (the faithful remnant) were gathered into the spiritual storehouse of the New Creation, while the "chaff" (the rebellious) were burned in the judgment of Jerusalem. This winnowing process was the official separation of the two covenants. Simultaneously, the baptism of Jesus serves as the pivotal coronation. The Spirit descending like a dove echoes the Spirit "hovering" over the waters in Genesis 1, signaling the birth of the New Creation. Jesus, as the "True Israel," succeeds where the nation failed. His baptism "fulfills all righteousness," meaning He completes the legal requirements of the Law to lead His people into a better tabernacle—one not made with hands. The coronation of the King at the Jordan was the beginning of the end for the Old World and the glorious dawn of the world we now inhabit.</p>

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. The Proximity of the Kingdom</h3>
  <p>The ministry of John the Baptist begins with a specific time-sensitive proclamation: "The Kingdom of the Heavens has come near." In the Full Preterist framework, this "nearness" (Greek: <i>engiken</i>) is an inspired declaration of objective, chronological imminence. John was not announcing a far-off spiritual realm or a kingdom that would be delayed for two millennia; he was announcing that the transition from the Old Covenant age to the Messianic age was literally at the door. The Kingdom was "at hand" for that generation. This proximity required an immediate response of repentance, as the legal "passing away" of the old world was about to begin. The Kingdom is a present, settled reality—not a future hope—and John was the herald of its inaugural stage. By AD 70, this Kingdom was fully manifested as the old "heaven and earth" of the Mosaic system were removed to make way for the spiritual, everlasting reign of Christ. We currently live in the "finished" state of this Kingdom, a reality that John saw as impending and ready to break through the veil of the Old Covenant.</p>

  <h3>2. The Judgment of the Old Trees</h3>
  <p>John’s warning to the Pharisees and Sadducees regarding the "coming wrath" is a direct reference to the impending destruction of Jerusalem. When he declares that the "axe is already laid to the root," he is emphasizing that the judgment process was not just a future possibility, but a present legal reality. The trees represent the leadership and the institutional structure of Israel under the Law. To be a "child of Abraham" by fleshly descent was no longer a shield against the legal requirements of the New Covenant. The "fire" John mentions is the specific, unquenchable fire of AD 70, which consumed the Temple and the physical genealogies. This judgment was the final "cutting down" of the Old Covenant tree. Full Preterism understands this "wrath" as the covenantal lawsuit of God against an apostate generation. It was the necessary removal of the old to allow the New Creation to stand without competition. The axe was not aimed at the end of the physical planet, but at the root of the Mosaic system that refused to bear fruit in the Light of the Messiah.</p>

  <h3>3. The Winnowing Shovel and the Separation</h3>
  <p>The imagery of the "winnowing shovel" and the "threshing-floor" describes the sorting process that occurred during the "last days" of the Old Covenant (the period between AD 30 and AD 70). Jesus came to cleanse His floor—corporate Israel. The "wheat" represents the faithful remnant, the first-century church, who were gathered into the spiritual "storehouse" of the New Creation. The "chaff" represents the rebellious elements of the nation who clung to the dead works of the Law and were subsequently "burned" in the judgment of Jerusalem. This winnowing process was the official separation of the two covenants. The baptism of "fire" was the destructive aspect of the Parousia for the unbelieving, while the baptism of the "Holy Spirit" was the transformative life given to the new humanity. This separation is a completed historical event. Today, the "floor" has been cleansed; there is no longer a "chaff" system competing for the title of God's people. We are the gathered wheat, dwelling safely in the storehouse of the New Covenant, which is the finished reality of the Kingdom of God.</p>

  <h3>4. The Anointing of the King</h3>
  <p>The baptism of Jesus is the pivotal moment of transition where the Spirit of God officially identifies the King. The voice from heaven, "This is My Son—the Beloved," is a Messianic coronation. The Spirit descending "as a dove" is a deliberate echo of the Spirit "hovering" over the waters in Genesis 1, signaling that the New Creation is now being birthed into time. In the Old Covenant, Israel was God’s "son" (Exodus 4:22), but they had proven unfaithful. Jesus, as the "True Israel," succeeds where the nation failed. His baptism "fulfills all righteousness," meaning He completes the legal requirements of the Law so that He can lead His people out from under its shadow. From a fulfilled perspective, this was the anointing of the High Priest of a new and better tabernacle—one not made with hands. The "delight" of the Father in the Son is now the status of every believer who is "in Christ." We do not live in the "shadow" of being a servant, but in the reality of being sons and daughters of the New Creation. The coronation of the King at the Jordan was the beginning of the end for the Old World and the glorious dawn of the world we now inhabit.</p>

  <h3>5. The Voice in the Wilderness</h3>
  <p>John’s identification as the "voice crying in the wilderness" (quoting Isaiah 40:3) establishes him as the final herald of the Law and the Prophets. The "wilderness" setting is typologically significant, representing the state of Israel—lost in a desert of legalism and spiritual exile. John’s mission was to "prepare the way," which meant preparing a people to move out of the old system and into the new. This preparation was for a "Coming" (Parousia) that John knew was imminent. He was the bridge between the age of shadows and the age of substance. In Full Preterism, we recognize that John’s mission was fully accomplished. The way was prepared, the King arrived, and the "paths" of God were made straight through the removal of the crooked and corrupted Mosaic leadership. We no longer live in a "wilderness" waiting for a voice or a path. The path has been walked, the destination has been reached, and the King is permanently seated. Our reality is the "Promised Land" of the New Creation, a spiritual country where the voice of God is no longer a cry from the desert, but a constant indwelling Presence.</p>

  <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
  <p>You do not live in a "wilderness" of waiting; you live in the "Promised Land" of the Kingdom. The axe has already fallen on the old system, and the chaff of the Law has been burned away. As a believer, you possess the baptism of the Holy Spirit—the permanent indwelling presence of God that identifies you as a beloved child. You are the "wheat" gathered into God's eternal storehouse. The "coming wrath" is a historical event, not a future fear, leaving you in a state of settled peace and eternal life.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Are you still living as if you are "fleeing from a wrath" that was already poured out in AD 70, or are you resting in the "delight" of the Father as a citizen of the New Creation?</p>
