<h1>1 Corinthians 3</h1>
<h2>One Foundation · God’s True Temple</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul tells the Corinthians he had to speak to them as infants, not because they lacked information,
but because they were still operating from jealousy, rivalry, and factional thinking.
Aligning under human leaders proves they are still thinking in old-world categories.
</p>

<p>
Paul and Apollos are servants, not sources.
One plants, another waters, but only God gives growth.
No human role carries identity weight.
God’s work alone defines value.
</p>

<p>
The community itself is God’s field and God’s building.
Paul laid a foundation, and others build on it,
but the foundation is already fixed — Jesus Christ.
Everything built on top will be tested by fire,
revealing whether it carries lasting substance or not.
</p>

<p>
If someone’s work survives, there is reward.
If it burns, the person still belongs to Christ,
but the work itself does not endure.
Salvation is not in question — construction quality is.
</p>

<p>
Paul then makes the decisive statement:
the believers together are God’s temple.
God’s Spirit dwells among them.
To destroy the community through division or rivalry
is to attack God’s dwelling place.
</p>

<p>
He concludes by dismantling boasting altogether.
No leader, no teacher, no status marker belongs to anyone.
All things belong to the people of God,
because they belong to Christ,
and Christ belongs to God.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Paul is confronting party religion.
The issue is not theology accuracy,
but identity displacement.
The Corinthians are importing old social hierarchies
into a New Covenant community.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Carnal vs spiritual is covenant thinking</h3>
<p>
“Fleshly” here does not mean immoral bodies.
It means living from competitive, status-driven systems.
“Spiritual” means living from shared life in the Spirit.
</p>

<h3>2) Fire tests works, not people</h3>
<p>
This is not a post-mortem judgment scene.
It describes present covenant testing.
What belongs to the old order does not survive;
what aligns with Christ endures.
</p>

<h3>3) Temple language is replacement language</h3>
<p>
Calling believers God’s temple announces the end
of building-centered access to God.
Presence has moved from stone to people.
</p>

<h3>4) Boasting collapses in the New Creation</h3>
<p>
If everything belongs to Christ,
no human mediator can claim ownership.
This ends celebrity religion at the root.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ezekiel 37 — people as God’s dwelling</li>
  <li>John 2 — Jesus replacing the temple</li>
  <li>Ephesians 2 — built together into God’s house</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You are not building your own spiritual résumé.
You are participating in God’s house.
Division destroys; love builds.
Christ alone is the foundation — and He is already laid.
</p>
