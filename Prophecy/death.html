  <section id="why-this-matters">
    <h2>Why this matters</h2>
    <p>
      “Death” is one of the most abused words in modern Christian talk. If you treat every biblical use of
      <em>death</em> as biological death, you will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>miss the Bible’s covenant storyline (Adam → Moses → Christ → New Creation),</li>
      <li>turn the gospel into fear-management (“what happens after you die?”), and</li>
      <li>accidentally smuggle futurism back in (postponing victory into an undefined “later”).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="kicker">Core claim:</span> Scripture often uses <strong>death</strong> as covenant language—separation from God’s life and presence
      under condemnation. Physical death is real, but it is not the primary “death problem” the gospel targets.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="two-senses">
    <h2>Two senses of “death” in Scripture</h2>

    <h3>1) Covenant / relational death (the dominant theological sense)</h3>
    <p>
      This is “death” as <strong>alienation</strong>, <strong>exile</strong>, <strong>condemnation</strong>, and being “cut off”
      from covenant life. It is the death of being outside the life of God—alive physically, yet under a verdict.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      This is why Scripture can speak of people as “dead” while they are still walking around (e.g., “dead in sins”),
      and why “life” is frequently defined as knowing God, belonging, and sharing in His Spirit.
    </div>

    <h3>2) Biological death (a real, universal human condition)</h3>
    <p>
      Bodies die. Scripture does not deny this. But the New Covenant claim is not “Christ stops funerals,”
      but “Christ ends condemnation and restores covenant life.” In other words: the gospel addresses
      the <em>reigning power</em> and <em>sting</em> of death—its legal and spiritual dominion—rather than trying to
      freeze history and biology.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="adam">
    <h2>Adam: “in the day you eat… you will die”</h2>
    <p>
      The Eden warning is the simplest proof that “death” is not automatically “biological death.”
      Adam did not drop dead physically “in the day” he ate. What happened “in the day” was covenant rupture:
      exile, shame, hiding, and removal from the garden—separation from life-as-communion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate effect:</strong> alienation (hiding, fear, blame, loss of access)</li>
      <li><strong>Covenant result:</strong> exile from the place of life</li>
      <li><strong>Story trajectory:</strong> humanity living east of Eden—outside fullness of presence</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Adam’s “death” is the Bible’s template: <strong>death = covenant separation</strong>.
      Physical dying becomes part of the human condition, but the theological “death” problem is deeper:
      being under alienation and condemnation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="law">
    <h2>The Law as “the ministry of death”</h2>
    <p>
      Paul’s language is blunt: the Mosaic system functions as a <strong>ministry of death</strong> and a
      <strong>ministry of condemnation</strong>. That doesn’t mean the Law was “bad.” It means the Law
      exposes, prosecutes, and sentences—because it is a covenant administration that measures righteousness
      and condemns transgression.
    </p>

    <h3>Death has “legal strength”</h3>
    <p>
      Paul explicitly ties the <em>power</em> of death to the Law’s prosecuting role:
      <span class="kicker">“the strength of sin is the Law.”</span>
      Where Law stands over a people as covenant prosecutor, sin has teeth—and death reigns as condemnation.
    </p>

    <h3>This is why “death” is not merely a biology term</h3>
    <p>
      If “death” were only “eventually your body dies,” then calling the Law “the ministry of death” would be meaningless.
      Bodies already died before Sinai and continued after Sinai. Paul’s point is covenantal:
      under Moses, Israel is under a system that can only condemn, never perfect the conscience, never grant final access.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <span class="kicker">Fulfilled lens:</span> When Christ fulfils and removes the condemning covenant,
      He removes the <em>legal basis</em> for death’s reign. Death can still occur biologically, but it no longer reigns
      as separation, verdict, or barrier to God.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="wages">
    <h2>“The wages of sin is death”</h2>
    <p>
      Read in context, this is not a simple proverb about “bad choices lead to dying.” Paul is contrasting two masters:
      sin and God, death and life. The “wages” language is covenantal and judicial—what sin pays out under condemnation.
    </p>

    <h3>Why this cannot mean “everyone eventually dies”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If Paul’s point were “sin causes physical death,” it would be a flat observation, not gospel contrast.</li>
      <li>Paul’s argument is about bondage, mastery, slavery, and release—covenantal categories.</li>
      <li>The opposite of the “wages” is “the free gift” (grace, union, Spirit-life), not “biological immortality.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="callout">
      <strong>In Paul, death is the covenantal outcome of sin under condemnation.</strong>
      Life is the covenantal outcome of being united to Christ under grace.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="resurrection">
    <h2>Resurrection: covenant transition, not corpse speculation</h2>
    <p>
      The New Testament “resurrection” proclamation is not a side-quest about anatomy. It is the declaration that God has:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ended Adamic exile by union with Christ,</li>
      <li>ended the condemning covenant by fulfilment, and</li>
      <li>brought His people into <strong>new-covenant life</strong> (Spirit, access, adoption, inheritance).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What resurrection means in the covenant story</h3>
    <p>
      Resurrection is the move from:
      <strong>death-in-Adam / under condemnation</strong>
      into
      <strong>life-in-Christ / in the Spirit</strong>.
      It is corporate (a people), historical (a covenant transition), and realized (a present standing).
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <span class="kicker">Important:</span> This does not deny bodily death. It denies that bodily death is the “last enemy”
      still ruling God’s people as separation and verdict. In Christ, death cannot separate, cannot condemn, cannot exclude.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="ad70">
    <h2>Why AD 70 is the decisive historical line</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible’s “end” language (wrath, judgment, coming, consummation) centers on the covenantal
      transition of AD 30–70, climaxing in the fall of Jerusalem and the removal of the Old Covenant world.
      That event is the public, historical closure of the system that administered condemnation.
    </p>

    <h3>So what actually “ended”?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>the authority of the Temple-centered order as covenant mediator</li>
      <li>the national-judicial system that prosecuted covenant transgression</li>
      <li>the “age” defined by Mosaic administration</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="callout">
      If the “ministry of condemnation” has ended, then death’s reign as covenant separation has ended.
      That is why the New Creation is not a future hope—it is the present covenant reality.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="what-happens">
    <h2>What happens when a believer dies now?</h2>
    <p>
      Here’s the line you want your site to hold firmly:
      <strong>Scripture gives assurance, not speculation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Covenant promise is not “we can map the afterlife.” It is:
      <strong>nothing separates us from Christ</strong>, and
      <strong>life in Him is not revoked by death</strong>.
      Death does not reintroduce exile. It does not reopen condemnation. It does not cancel union.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <p class="kicker">What we can say confidently (without making things up):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Union with Christ is real now and not fragile.</li>
        <li>There is no pending wrath or covenant trial hanging over believers.</li>
        <li>God’s presence is not “paused” by biological death.</li>
        <li>The gospel’s purpose is present reconciliation and Spirit-life, not timelines.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="callout">
      When Christians obsess over “where do you go when you die?” they often drift into fear-based religion.
      The apostolic emphasis is stronger: <strong>you have life now</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="pastoral">
    <h2>Pastoral clarity: fear, manipulation, and the gospel</h2>
    <p>
      A weak “death” doctrine creates powerful levers for religious control:
      end-times fear, altar-call panic, and endless “just in case” anxiety. That is not how the New Covenant speaks.
    </p>
    <h3>What the gospel does</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Removes condemnation</strong> (no Law-prosecutor over you)</li>
      <li><strong>Gives access</strong> (presence without a Temple system)</li>
      <li><strong>Creates a new identity</strong> (in Christ, in the Spirit)</li>
      <li><strong>Produces love and holiness</strong> from freedom, not threat</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <span class="kicker">If your “death teaching” produces chronic fear,</span>
      it is probably importing a covenant framework that Christ already ended.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="quick-summary">
    <h2>Quick summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Death</strong> in Scripture is often covenantal: exile, condemnation, separation from covenant life.</li>
      <li><strong>The Law</strong> is called “the ministry of death” because it prosecutes and condemns.</li>
      <li><strong>Christ</strong> defeats death by fulfilling and removing the condemning covenant—ending death’s reign as verdict.</li>
      <li><strong>AD 70</strong> is the historical closure of the Old Covenant world and its Temple-centered authority.</li>
      <li><strong>Believers today</strong> don’t need speculation: nothing separates us from Christ, and death cannot undo union.</li>
    </ul>
