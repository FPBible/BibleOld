<h1>1 Corinthians 2</h1>
<h2>Revealed Wisdom · Life Known by the Spirit</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase (1 Corinthians 2)</h2>

<p><strong>2:1–5</strong> When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom, proclaiming the testimony of God. I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus the Messiah—and Him crucified. I was with you in weakness, fear, and trembling. My message and proclamation were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power, so that your faith would not rest on human wisdom, but on the power of God.</p>

<p><strong>2:6–8</strong> Yet we do speak wisdom among the mature—but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing. Instead, we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>

<p><strong>2:9–10</strong> As it is written, “What eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and what has not entered the human heart—what God has prepared for those who love Him.” But God has revealed these things to us through the Spirit. The Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.</p>

<p><strong>2:11–13</strong> For who knows a person’s thoughts except the person’s spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God. We speak these things not in words taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual realities to those who are spiritual.</p>

<p><strong>2:14–16</strong> The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, because they are foolishness to him; he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person discerns all things, yet is judged by no one. “For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>
<p>
Paul continues dismantling Corinth’s obsession with status, rhetoric, and philosophical dominance.
He contrasts two wisdom systems: one sourced from the present age and its rulers,
and one revealed by the Spirit through the cross.
This is not anti-intellect; it is anti-boasting.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Covenant / New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) The cross redefines wisdom</h3>
<p>
Paul does not reject wisdom itself.
He rejects wisdom rooted in power, prestige, and control.
The cross reveals a wisdom that ends domination and exposes the emptiness
of the old age’s value system.
</p>

<h3>2) “Rulers of this age” are covenant authorities</h3>
<p>
These rulers are not merely political figures.
They represent the governing structures of the old covenant world—
religious leadership, legal systems, and authority frameworks
that failed to recognize God’s work in Christ.
That age is now being brought to nothing.
</p>

<h3>3) Mystery means "once hidden, now revealed"</h3>
<p>
“Mystery” is not secrecy for insiders.
It is something formerly hidden in Scripture
now unveiled through Christ.
What was anticipated in shadows
is now openly known by the Spirit.
</p>

<h3>4) “What eye has not seen” is present revelation</h3>
<p>
Paul does not push this text into the afterlife.
He explicitly says God <em>has revealed</em> these things now.
New Covenant life is not postponed.
It is known, experienced, and shared in the present.
</p>

<h3>5) The Spirit grants shared knowledge, not elite insight</h3>
<p>
The Spirit does not create a new hierarchy.
The Spirit gives access.
What is “freely given” belongs to the whole body,
not to an enlightened class.
This undercuts every form of spiritual elitism.
</p>

<h3>6) “Mind of Christ” describes covenant consciousness</h3>
<p>
This is not mystical mind-reading.
It is shared perspective.
Believers participate in Christ’s way of seeing—
cross-shaped, self-giving, and free from old-world metrics.

  <li><strong>“Natural person”</strong> — One operating from old-age categories.</li>
  <li><strong>“Spiritual”</strong> — One participating in New Covenant reality.</li>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
1 Corinthians 2 frees you from striving to prove insight or depth.
You are not climbing toward revelation.
You live from revelation already given.
The Spirit is not teasing truth from a distance;
He is sharing what belongs to you in Christ.
That ends insecurity and dismantles spiritual comparison.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be measuring wisdom by old-world standards
instead of living from the mind of Christ?
