<h1>Matthew 5</h1>
<h2>The New Law of the Kingdom</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus ascends a mountain, deliberately mirroring Moses at Sinai. But unlike Moses, who brought a Law written on stone that condemned the people, Jesus sits down to deliver the manifesto of the New Covenant. He is not merely interpreting the Torah; He is assuming authority <em>over</em> it. This sermon establishes the values of the coming Kingdom and sets the timeline for the end of the Mosaic Age.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mountain, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,
    <span class="v-num">2</span> and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">3</span> “Happy the poor in spirit—because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
    <span class="v-num">4</span> Happy the mourning—because they shall be comforted.
    <span class="v-num">5</span> Happy the meek—because they shall inherit the land.
    <span class="v-num">6</span> Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness—because they shall be filled.
    <span class="v-num">7</span> Happy the kind—because they shall find kindness.
    <span class="v-num">8</span> Happy the clean in heart—because they shall see God.
    <span class="v-num">9</span> Happy the peacemakers—because they shall be called Sons of God.
    <span class="v-num">10</span> Happy those persecuted for righteousness’ sake—because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
    <span class="v-num">11</span> Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake—
    <span class="v-num">12</span> rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward [is] great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">13</span> Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt may lose savor, in what shall it be salted? It is good for nothing thenceforth, except to be cast without, and trodden down by men.
    <span class="v-num">14</span> Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a hill cannot be hid,
    <span class="v-num">15</span> nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house;
    <span class="v-num">16</span> so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who [is] in the heavens.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">17</span> Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets; I did not come to throw down, but to fulfill;
    <span class="v-num">18</span> for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle may not pass away from the law, till that all may happen.
    <span class="v-num">19</span> Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands—the least—and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
    <span class="v-num">20</span> For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound more than [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">21</span> Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;
    <span class="v-num">22</span> but I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council, and whoever may say, Fool, shall be in danger of the hell of the fire.
    <span class="v-num">23</span> If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar, and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee,
    <span class="v-num">24</span> leave there thy gift before the altar, and go—first be reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift.
    <span class="v-num">25</span> Be agreeing with thine opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and into prison thou mayest be cast,
    <span class="v-num">26</span> verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence till that thou mayest pay the last farthing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">27</span> Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not commit adultery;
    <span class="v-num">28</span> but I say to you, that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in his heart.
    <span class="v-num">29</span> But if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.
    <span class="v-num">30</span> And if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.
    <span class="v-num">31</span> And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce;
    <span class="v-num">32</span> but I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">33</span> Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths;
    <span class="v-num">34</span> but I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God,
    <span class="v-num">35</span> nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King,
    <span class="v-num">36</span> nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not able one hair to make white or black;
    <span class="v-num">37</span> but let your word be, Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay, and that which is more than these is of the evil.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">38</span> Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth;
    <span class="v-num">39</span> but I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;
    <span class="v-num">40</span> and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and to take thy coat, suffer him to take the cloak also.
    <span class="v-num">41</span> And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two,
    <span class="v-num">42</span> to him who is asking of thee give, and him who is wishing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">43</span> Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine enemy;
    <span class="v-num">44</span> but I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you and persecuting you,
    <span class="v-num">45</span> that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth rain on righteous and unrighteous.
    <span class="v-num">46</span> For if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?
    <span class="v-num">47</span> And if ye may salute your brethren only, what abundant thing do ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers so?
    <span class="v-num">48</span> Ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who [is] in the heavens is perfect.”

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>5:18 — Heaven and earth:</strong> A common Hebrew idiom for the Covenant Order (the Temple system and the Law), not the physical planet. See Isaiah 51:16.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>5:18 — One iota or tittle:</strong> The smallest strokes in Hebrew writing. Jesus guarantees that the Old Covenant remains completely binding until it is completely fulfilled.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>5:22 — Hell of the fire (Gehenna):</strong> Literally the Valley of Hinnom, the city dump of Jerusalem. A warning of the physical siege and destruction of AD 70, not eternal torture.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>5:48 — Perfect:</strong> Literally "complete" or "mature." Refers to the maturity of the New Covenant love, contrasting with the partial nature of the Law.</div>
</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) "Heaven and Earth" Have Passed Away</h3>
<p>
Verse 18 is the linchpin of the chapter. Jesus says the Law will remain <em>"until heaven and earth pass away."</em> Most churches teach this means the Law is binding forever because the physical earth is still here. This is a massive category error. In biblical prophecy (Deut 32:1, Isa 1:2, Isa 51:16), "Heaven and Earth" is covenantal language for the Old Mosaic Order—the Temple (Heaven) and the Land (Earth). When the Temple was destroyed in AD 70, the "Heaven and Earth" of the Old Covenant passed away with a great noise (2 Peter 3:10).
</p>

<h3>2) We are NOT under the "Jot and Tittle"</h3>
<p>
Because the "Heaven and Earth" of the Old Order <em>has</em> passed, the condition of verse 18 has been met. This is crucial: Jesus did not come to destroy the Law, but to <strong>fulfill</strong> it. Once a contract is fulfilled, its terms (the jots and tittles) are no longer binding. We are not under the "jot and tittle" of the Mosaic code—we are under the New Covenant of the Spirit. The lease on the Old House has expired; we live in the New Creation.
</p>

<h3>3) Gehenna was a Historical Warning</h3>
<p>
Jesus warns that calling a brother "Fool" puts one in danger of "Gehenna fire" (v. 22). This is not a threat of the afterlife; it is a warning about the coming social breakdown in Jerusalem. As the Jewish war approached, infighting and hatred (zealotry) would literally lead people to be cast into the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna) outside the city walls during the siege. Jesus is saving His people from the specific historical judgment of AD 70.
</p>

<h3>4) Raising the Standard to the Heart</h3>
<p>
Jesus moves the locus of authority from external tablets to the human heart. The Old Law said "Don't murder"; Jesus says "Don't hate." This is not <em>harder</em> law; it is <em>different</em> law—the Law of the Spirit of Life. By fixing the root (the heart), the fruit (actions) takes care of itself. We do not keep the Law to prevent the world from ending; we live in love because the New World has begun.

</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
We live on the other side of AD 70. The "Heaven and Earth" of the Mosaic system is gone. We do not look to the Torah for our standing, nor do we fear that "one jot" missing will condemn us. We are the "City on a Hill" (v. 14)—the established New Jerusalem, shining the light of the finished work of Christ to the nations. The jots are gone; the Spirit remains.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Do I live with the freedom of someone whose "contract" has been fully paid and retired, or am I still checking the fine print of the Old Law, worrying about jots and tittles that Jesus has already fulfilled?
