      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Isaiah is addressing a deeply compromised Judah and Jerusalem in the 8th century BC. The city is crowded with wealth, military alliances, idols, and absolute confidence in human power. In this oracle, Isaiah holds together two profound realities that will define the end of the Old Covenant age: first, Zion will be established as God’s true teaching-centre, drawing the Gentile nations into His rule. Second, the "Day of Yahweh" will arrive to violently shatter the pride-system of apostate Israel, forcing them to abandon their idols and recognize that Yahweh alone is exalted.

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) Zion is Covenant Government, Not a Tourist Destination</h3>
            <p>
        Isaiah speaks “concerning Judah and Jerusalem,” but immediately moves beyond mere geography. In ancient prophetic speech, mountains are ruling-heights—centres of authority that shape a people’s life. “The mountain of Yahweh’s house” being established above all mountains announces covenant supremacy: God’s rule becomes the defining centre, higher than every competing height. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Zion is presented as the true place of instruction because God Himself establishes it. When Hebrews 12 tells first-century believers, "You have come to Mount Zion," it confirms this is a present, spiritual reality—the New Covenant Church—not a future real-estate project.
      </p>

      <h3>2) “In the Latter Days” Identifies the Covenant Transition</h3>
      <p>
        “In the latter days” is time-language inside the covenant story. It marks the closing stretch of the old Mosaic order and the public establishment of the new. The apostles universally recognized that they were living in these "latter days" (Acts 2:17, Hebrews 1:2, 1 Peter 1:20). The prophets repeatedly spoke of a climactic season in which God would expose false confidence, judge the apostate nation, and settle His rule globally. Isaiah 2 holds those themes together perfectly.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Nations Flow Because Yahweh Teaches</h3>
      <p>
        Under ancient empires, nations were brought to the capital city in chains as conquered captives. But in Isaiah's vision, the nations come voluntarily as peoples seeking instruction: “he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is covenant gathering through the Word. Zion becomes the source-point of God’s law—His revealed will and His life-giving speech. The flow to Zion is the ingathering of the Gentiles into God’s rule through the Gospel. The Great Commission (Matthew 28) is the mechanism by which the law goes out from Zion to the ends of the earth.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Peace is the Fruit of God’s Settled Judgment</h3>
            <p>
        “He will judge between the nations” sits at the centre of the peace imagery. When God decides disputes, the engine of hostility is dismantled. Beating swords into plowshares is not a sentimental fantasy about the end of all global military conflict; it is a covenant reality. Life under God’s rule is no longer sustained by violence, ethnic threat, or carnal rivalry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The dividing wall of hostility between Jew and Gentile has been broken down by the cross (Ephesians 2:14). The energy once spent on enmity is redirected into the fruitfulness of the Kingdom. Inside the true Zion, nations no longer learn war as a covenant discipline.
      </p>

      <h3>5) Judah’s Problem: A Counterfeit Confidence-System</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning in verse 6, Isaiah stacks the indictment against Jerusalem: borrowed spiritual practice, foreign alliances, silver and gold, horses and chariots, and idols. This is a public structure of self-sufficiency. 
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Divination</strong> is counterfeit guidance.</li>
          <li><strong>Alliances</strong> are counterfeit security.</li>
          <li><strong>Wealth</strong> is a counterfeit future.</li>
          <li><strong>Horses and chariots</strong> are a counterfeit salvation.</li>
          <li><strong>Idols</strong> are a counterfeit presence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The covenant people were surrounded by the true God, yet living as though God was optional. Isaiah exposes it as total abandonment of their covenant mandate.
      </p>

      <h3>6) The Day of Yahweh Humbles Every Rival Height</h3>
      <p>
        Because of this rebellion, the "Day of Yahweh" must come. The chapter repeats the same absolute verdict: lofty looks brought low, arrogance bowed down, and Yahweh alone exalted. Isaiah lists cedars, oaks, mountains, hills, towers, walls, and ships. This is the anatomy of human glory—natural emblems of military confidence, economic reach, and cultural splendour. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah is not condemning trees and boats as evil; he is announcing that every emblem of self-exaltation will collapse under God’s action. When Yahweh rose in judgment against Jerusalem in AD 70, the entire architecture of their pride was reduced to ash and rubble.
      </p>

      <h3>7) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        To grasp the power of Isaiah 2, we must avoid modern political projections.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>This chapter is <strong>not</strong> a prophecy about the modern United Nations successfully ending all geopolitical wars on planet Earth.</li>
          <li>It is <strong>not</strong> predicting a future 1,000-year millennium where a physical Jewish temple rules the world with an iron rod.</li>
          <li>It is <strong>not</strong> suggesting that modern Christians should adopt pacifism in civil matters. The "swords to plowshares" is covenantal, spiritual reconciliation inside the body of Christ.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8) The Covenant Resolution: Stop Trusting in Man</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah ends with a command that lands like a hammer: “Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for of what account is he?” (v. 22). It is not hatred of humanity; it is clear-eyed covenant sanity. Human systems rise and fall. Human strength cannot bear the weight of worship. The old Jerusalem trusted in its walls and its pedigree, and it was destroyed. The New Jerusalem trusts solely in the finished work of Christ, and it stands forever.

      <p>
        Zion stands today as God’s settled centre: instruction goes out, the Gospel gathers the nations, hostility is disarmed at the cross, and every rival confidence is exposed as empty. Life in the Spirit is not built on human strength, political power, or fear of the future—it is built on Yahweh’s faithfulness and His present rule. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> The Mountain of the Lord is established, and the doors are wide open.
