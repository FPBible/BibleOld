<h1>John 15</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>
<hr/>

<p>Jesus said, “I am the true vine, and My Father is the gardener. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He removes, and every branch that bears fruit He prunes so that it may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.</p>
<p>Remain in Me, and I in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever remains in Me bears much fruit, because apart from Me you can do nothing.</p>
<p>If anyone does not remain in Me, he is thrown out like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered and burned. If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</p>
<p>By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be My disciples. Just as the Father loved Me, I have loved you. Remain in My love. I have spoken these things so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.”</p>
<hr/>

<p>Jesus continued, “This is My commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. You are My friends if you do what I command.</p>
<p>I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because everything I heard from My Father I have made known to you.</p>
<p>You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit — fruit that remains — so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.</p>
<p>If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. But because you do not belong to the world, it hates you.</p>
<p>When the Helper comes, whom I will send from the Father — the Spirit of truth — He will testify about Me. And you also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.”</p>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The disciples during the final night before the crucifixion</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The true Israel is being defined as union with Christ, not descent from Abraham</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus identifies Himself as the fulfillment of Israel’s vine imagery and redefines fruitfulness, belonging, and judgment.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) “I am the true vine” replaces old Israel</h3>
<p>Israel was repeatedly called God’s vine, yet failed to produce fruit. Jesus now identifies Himself as the true vine, redefining covenant identity around union with Him rather than ethnicity or Law.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>National Israel as the covenant vine, Law-defined fruitfulness, and external markers of belonging.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>A living union with Christ producing fruit through shared life, not religious striving.</p>
<h3>4) Pruning is covenant transition, not punishment</h3>
<p>The pruning language reflects removal from the old system and refinement within the new. This is not about individual condemnation but covenant realignment.</p>
<h3>5) “Thrown into the fire”</h3>
<p>This imagery points to covenant judgment on fruitless branches within Israel, culminating in the first-century judgment that removed the old vine structure.</p>
<h3>6) Friendship replaces servanthood</h3>
<p>Jesus elevates His disciples from servants under command to friends sharing knowledge and purpose. This reflects full covenant inclusion.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The true vine stands as Jerusalem’s old vine is judged and removed. The fruit-bearing community continues beyond AD 70 as the New Creation people.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>You do not strive to produce life — you remain in the Life that already flows. Fruit is not forced; it grows naturally from union with Christ.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Where might you be trying to produce fruit apart from simply remaining in Christ?</p>
