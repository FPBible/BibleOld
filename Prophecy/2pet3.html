<h1>2 Peter 3</h1>
<h2>Heavens and Earth · Covenant Dissolution and Renewal</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Reading Frame (Mandatory)</strong><br />
  2 Peter 3 is not a prediction of the physical universe being incinerated.
  It is covenant-judgment language describing the removal of the Old Covenant order
  and the establishment of the New Covenant world.
  Peter explicitly anchors his language in Israel’s Scriptures,
  not modern cosmology.
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>“Heavens and earth” is covenantal language</li>
  <li>The scoffers problem is covenant delay, not scientific skepticism</li>
  <li>“Elements” refers to covenantal principles, not atoms</li>
  <li>Fire imagery denotes judgment and purification</li>
  <li>The New Heavens and Earth arrive through covenant transition</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>1) The Real Problem Peter Addresses</h2>

<p>
Scoffers say:
“Where is the promise of His coming?
Everything continues as it has since the fathers fell asleep.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:4)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Context Check</strong><br />
  The issue is not modern unbelief in miracles.
  It is Jewish mockery of Jesus’ promised judgment on Jerusalem.
  The “fathers” are covenant ancestors, not prehistoric humans.
</div>

<h2>2) Peter’s Appeal to Creation and Flood</h2>

<p>
Peter references creation and the flood:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:5–6)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Critical Clarification</strong><br />
  Peter is not saying the planet ceased to exist at the flood.
  He uses the flood as a precedent for world-ending judgment
  that nevertheless leaves the physical earth intact.
</div>

<h2>3) “The Heavens and Earth That Now Exist”</h2>

<p>
“The heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:7)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Key Insight</strong><br />
  “That now exist” refers to the present covenant order.
  Scripture repeatedly uses “heavens and earth”
  to describe covenant systems (see Isaiah 1, 51, 65; Psalm 102).
</div>

<h2>4) The Meaning of “Day of the Lord”</h2>

<p>
“The day of the Lord will come like a thief.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:10)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Consistent Usage</strong><br />
  In the prophets, “day of the Lord” always refers
  to historical judgment on nations.
  Peter uses it the same way — culminating in Jerusalem’s fall.
</div>

<h2>5) “The Heavens Will Pass Away”</h2>

<p>
“The heavens will pass away with a roar.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:10)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Covenantal Language</strong><br />
  Passing away language echoes Psalm 102 and Isaiah 51,
  both applied by Hebrews to the covenant transition.
  The heavens that pass are the ruling structures of the old order.
</div>

<h2>6) “Elements Will Be Dissolved”</h2>

<p>
“The elements will be dissolved with fire.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:10)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Decisive Point</strong><br />
  The Greek <em>stoicheia</em> consistently refers to
  covenantal principles, ordinances, and rudiments
  (see Gal 4, Col 2, Heb 5–6).
  Peter is not talking about atoms.
</div>

<h2>7) Fire as Covenant Judgment</h2>

<p>
Fire imagery saturates prophetic judgment texts.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAL04.htm">(Mal 4)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Purification, Not Annihilation</strong><br />
  Fire refines, judges, and removes what cannot remain.
  It does not imply the obliteration of creation itself.
</div>

<h2>8) “The Earth and Works Will Be Exposed”</h2>

<p>
“The earth and the works done in it will be exposed.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:10)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Judicial Language</strong><br />
  Exposure is courtroom language.
  The works judged are covenant works,
  particularly those tied to the old system.
</div>

<h2>9) Ethical Urgency, Not Escape</h2>

<p>
“What sort of people ought you to be…”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:11)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Practical Focus</strong><br />
  Peter urges holy living because judgment is near,
  not because believers are leaving the earth.
  The concern is faithfulness during transition.
</div>

<h2>10) “New Heavens and a New Earth”</h2>

<p>
“According to His promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/2PE03.htm">(2 Pet 3:13)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Isaiah Connection</strong><br />
  Peter quotes Isaiah 65–66.
  Those chapters describe people still living, working, and dying —
  proving the language is covenantal, not cosmic.
</div>

<h2>11) “Waiting” Does Not Mean Still Future</h2>

<p>
Peter speaks of “waiting” during his lifetime.
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Transition Period</strong><br />
  The waiting belongs to the overlap period
  between Christ’s work and the final removal
  of the old covenant structures.
  Once complete, the New Creation stands fully revealed.
</div>

<h2>12) Harmony with Jesus and Paul</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus — “Heaven and earth will pass away” (Matt 24:35)</li>
  <li>Paul — “The present form of this world is passing away” (1 Cor 7:31)</li>
  <li>Hebrews — “What is obsolete is ready to vanish” (Heb 8:13)</li>
</ul>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>No Contradictions</strong><br />
  All three describe the same covenant transition.
  None predict planetary destruction.
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>2 Peter 3 uses covenantal creation language</li>
  <li>The “elements” are covenantal structures</li>
  <li>Fire denotes judgment and purification</li>
  <li>The Old Covenant heavens and earth pass away</li>
  <li>The New Covenant world emerges fully</li>
</ul>
