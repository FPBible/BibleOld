<h1>Revelation 11</h1>
<h2>Witness, Judgment, and the Kingdom Announced</h2>

<p class="hide-element note">
Original text:

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 10 declared that delay was ending. Revelation 11 shows what that means on the ground:
measured covenant space, faithful witness under pressure, persecution, vindication,
and the public announcement of God’s reign. This chapter stands at the hinge of the book.
What the seals and trumpets warned, this chapter confirms.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Measured Space: Protection and Accountability (11:1–2)</h3>
<p>
John is given a measuring rod and told to measure the temple, the altar, and the worshipers.
The outer court is excluded and given over to trampling for a defined period.
</p>
<p>
Measurement signals ownership and preservation.
What belongs to God is known and secured,
even while surrounding structures face judgment.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Two Witnesses: Faithful Testimony Under Pressure (11:3–6)</h3>
<p>
Two witnesses are appointed to testify for a fixed time.
They are clothed in sackcloth—prophetic mourning and warning.
They are described as lampstands and olive trees,
symbols of covenant witness empowered by God.
</p>
<p>
Their testimony confronts resistance.
They stand with authority to announce judgment and restraint.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Opposition, Death, and Public Mockery (11:7–10)</h3>
<p>
When their testimony is complete,
the beastly power opposing God’s purposes kills them.
Their bodies lie exposed in the great city,
symbolically called Sodom and Egypt,
where the Lord was crucified.
</p>
<p>
The world celebrates their silencing.
Truth is treated as a threat, and its removal is applauded.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Vindication and Exaltation (11:11–13)</h3>
<p>
After a short time, God’s breath enters the witnesses.
They stand, and fear falls on observers.
They are called up before all.
</p>
<p>
A great shaking follows.
A portion of the city collapses.
Survivors are forced to acknowledge God’s authority.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Seventh Trumpet: The Kingdom Announced (11:14–19)</h3>
<p>
The seventh trumpet sounds, and voices declare:
“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,
and He shall reign forever.”
</p>
<p>
The elders worship, giving thanks that God has taken His power and begun to reign.
Judgment is announced, vindication is granted to the faithful,
and the covenant is publicly affirmed.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> This is not the start of God’s reign but its public declaration.
The language announces covenant transfer of authority within history,
not the end of the physical universe.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Measuring defines what belongs to God</h3>
<p>
Measurement is covenant language.
It marks protection and accountability.
God distinguishes between what is preserved and what is given over to judgment.
</p>

<h3>2) The witnesses represent covenant testimony</h3>
<p>
The two witnesses are not future individuals.
They embody faithful covenant witness—law and prophets,
faithful proclamation empowered by God in a hostile environment.
</p>

<h3>3) “The great city” is covenantally identified</h3>
<p>
Calling the city Sodom and Egypt is prophetic indictment language.
It identifies covenant unfaithfulness and oppression,
not geographical curiosity.
</p>

<h3>4) Death does not end testimony</h3>
<p>
The witnesses are silenced only temporarily.
Their vindication shows that persecution does not defeat God’s word.
Public truth is restored, not erased.
</p>

<h3>5) The seventh trumpet declares accomplished reign</h3>
<p>
“He has begun to reign” is not future hope but present announcement.
The kingdom is proclaimed as fact.
The covenant shift is declared complete in principle
and unfolding in history.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 11 declares that faithful witness matters,
even when it is costly.
God measures, preserves, vindicates, and reigns.
New Creation people live from the certainty
that the kingdom has been announced
and allegiance has been clarified.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I tempted to soften or silence my witness for comfort or approval?
What changes if I trust that faithfulness—not survival—
is the measure God honours?
</p>
