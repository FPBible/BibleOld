    <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
    <p>
      Matthew 21 is the public turning point: Jesus enters Jerusalem as King, confronts the temple economy, and speaks covenant-judgment parables that place Israel’s leadership under immediate indictment as the AD 30–70 transition reaches its final phase.

    <h2>Scripture (WEB)</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="scripture-text">

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">1</span>When they came near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
          <span class="v-num">2</span>saying to them, “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me.
          <span class="v-num">3</span>If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”
          <span class="v-num">4</span>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
          <span class="v-num">5</span>“Tell the daughter of Zion, behold, your King comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”
          <span class="v-num">6</span>The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
          <span class="v-num">7</span>and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.
          <span class="v-num">8</span>A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.
          <span class="v-num">9</span>The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, “Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”
          <span class="v-num">10</span>When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”
          <span class="v-num">11</span>The multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">12</span>Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
          <span class="v-num">13</span>He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of robbers!”
          <span class="v-num">14</span>The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
          <span class="v-num">15</span>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant,
          <span class="v-num">16</span>and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babies and infants you have perfected praise?’”
          <span class="v-num">17</span>He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">18</span>Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
          <span class="v-num">19</span>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, “Let there be no fruit from you forever!” Immediately the fig tree withered away.
          <span class="v-num">20</span>When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”
          <span class="v-num">21</span>Jesus answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.
          <span class="v-num">22</span>All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">23</span>When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
          <span class="v-num">24</span>Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
          <span class="v-num">25</span>The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?”
          <span class="v-num">26</span>They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
          <span class="v-num">27</span>But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”
          <span class="v-num">28</span>They answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.” He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">29</span>“But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’
          <span class="v-num">30</span>He answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind and went.
          <span class="v-num">31</span>He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but he didn’t go.
          <span class="v-num">32</span>Which of the two did the will of his father?”
          <span class="v-num">33</span>They said to him, “The first.”
          <span class="v-num">34</span>Jesus said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you.
          <span class="v-num">35</span>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward, that you might believe him.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">36</span>“Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.
          <span class="v-num">37</span>When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruit.
          <span class="v-num">38</span>The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
          <span class="v-num">39</span>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.
          <span class="v-num">40</span>But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
          <span class="v-num">41</span>But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and seize his inheritance.’
          <span class="v-num">42</span>So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
          <span class="v-num">43</span>When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”
          <span class="v-num">44</span>They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.”
          <span class="v-num">45</span>Jesus said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes?’
          <span class="v-num">46</span>“Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing its fruit.
          <span class="v-num">47</span>He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.”
          <span class="v-num">48</span>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.
          <span class="v-num">49</span>When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.

    <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

    <h3>1) The King enters: Zion is confronted in public</h3>
    <p>
      Matthew 21 is not “nice Palm Sunday vibes”—it is a royal claim that forces a verdict. Jesus deliberately fulfills the Zion-king prophecy by entering humbly on a donkey. That humility is not weakness; it is the form of His kingship. In Israel’s story, Jerusalem was the covenant center where God’s name dwelt. If the true King arrives there, the city must either receive Him and transition into New Creation life, or reject Him and come under the covenant lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city being “stirred up” is covenant tremor language: the arrival of the Messiah shakes the old order. People ask, “Who is this?”—and that question becomes the city’s judgment. Jerusalem’s leaders will treat Him as a threat, not a fulfillment, and that refusal is the seed of AD 70.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Temple cleansing: not reform, but exposure and replacement</h3>
    <p>
      Jesus drives out sellers and overturns tables because the temple had become a machine for religious extraction. “House of prayer” versus “den of robbers” is not merely a complaint about commerce; it is a prophetic indictment. The prophets used “robbers” language for covenant-breaking leadership who hide behind sacred space while devouring the vulnerable. Jesus’ act is a sign: the temple is no longer functioning as intended, and its days are numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detail that the blind and lame come to Him in the temple is surgical. Under the old system, access was controlled, stratified, and often exclusionary. Jesus heals in the temple as a living preview: true access is in Him, not in the building. Children praising Him in the temple drives the knife deeper—pure dependence recognizes the King while the officials become indignant. That’s the transition in miniature: the remnant receives, the leadership resists.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Fig tree: covenant sign-act of Israel’s fruitlessness</h3>
    <p>
      The fig tree with leaves but no fruit is a covenant picture: outward show without the fruit of justice, mercy, and faithful response to God’s visitation. Jesus’ word withers it immediately as a prophetic sign-act. This is not about Jesus being impatient with botany; it is about Him announcing that the covenant tree, as administered by the leadership, is barren and about to be judged.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fits the AD 30–70 overlap: there is a final season of visitation, preaching, warning, and invitation—but the leadership’s refusal hardens. The withering points forward to the historical withering of the temple-centered world in AD 70.
    </p>

    <h3>4) “This mountain” and the removal of covenant structures</h3>
    <p>
      Jesus’ “this mountain” language should not be flattened into generic motivation. In the Jerusalem context, mountain imagery naturally invokes the temple mount and the covenant center. Faith here is not “positive thinking”; it is Spirit-anchored allegiance to the King that participates in the removal of an obsolete covenant structure. The old world is not dismantled by human revolt; it is dismantled by God’s own covenant action—announced by Christ, accomplished in His death/resurrection, and historically resolved by AD 70.
    </p>

    <h3>5) Authority showdown: leadership cannot answer because they fear losing control</h3>
    <p>
      When leaders challenge Jesus’ authority, He exposes their fear-based calculation. They won’t say John is from heaven because that condemns them; they won’t say John is from men because they fear the crowd. This is what covenant corruption looks like: truth is weighed against political safety. In the transition, that posture becomes fatal because it prevents repentance and locks the leadership into self-preservation—right up to the catastrophe.
    </p>

    <h3>6) Two sons: covenant lip-service versus actual response</h3>
    <p>
      The parable of the two sons exposes Israel’s leadership: they say “I go, sir” but refuse God’s call. The surprising twist is that tax collectors and prostitutes enter the Kingdom ahead of them—not because sin is celebrated, but because repentance is real. The Kingdom is not inherited by status, but by response. This is covenant reversal again: the “clean” category collapses, and faith-response becomes the true marker of belonging.
    </p>

    <h3>7) Vineyard tenants: the covenant transfer is declared plainly</h3>
    <p>
      The vineyard story is the most explicit covenant lawsuit in the chapter. Israel is God’s vineyard; leaders are tenants; prophets are servants; the Son is sent last. The tenants’ plan—kill the heir and seize the inheritance—is precisely what the leadership will do. Then Jesus forces the verdict: what will the owner do? They pronounce their own sentence. Jesus then states the outcome in direct covenant language: the Kingdom will be taken from them and given to a fruit-bearing nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not “God is done with Jews”; it is “God is done with that covenant administration.” The new “nation” is the New Covenant people in Christ—Jew and Gentile together—producing the fruit the Law never produced. The transfer becomes historically visible as the temple falls and the New Creation people remain, living as God’s true dwelling.
    </p>

    <h3>8) The rejected stone: cornerstone shift and AD 70 consequence</h3>
    <p>
      The cornerstone quote is the interpretive key: leadership rejects, God exalts. The stone breaks those who stumble, and it crushes those it falls upon—judgment imagery that lands in first-century Jerusalem’s fate. The cornerstone is Christ; the new building is not the temple; it is the living house of the Spirit. That is why the old building can fall without the Kingdom collapsing. The Kingdom is not located in stone; it is located in the King.

    <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
    <p>
      The King has already claimed His house: you are not trying to “get access” through religious systems, but living from direct presence—bearing fruit that comes from union, not from temple-performance.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Where am I tempted to offer God “leaves” (appearance, identity, talk) while withholding “fruit” (real response, humility, mercy)—and what would change if I let the King cleanse that space?
