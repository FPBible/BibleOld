    <h1>Matthew 6 — True Righteousness in the Father’s Presence</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
    <p>
      Matthew 6 continues the Sermon on the Mount by exposing performative “righteousness” inside the temple-age world and relocating devotion from public status systems to direct Father-relationship—preparing disciples to live as New Covenant people while the old order nears its historical removal.
    </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">1</span>“Be careful that you don’t do your charitable giving‡ NU reads “acts of righteousness” instead of “charitable giving” before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
        <span class="v-num">2</span>Therefore, when you do merciful deeds, don’t sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
        <span class="v-num">3</span>But when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does,
        <span class="v-num">4</span>so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then <strong>your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">5</span>“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.
        <span class="v-num">6</span>But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to <strong>your Father who is in secret</strong>; and <strong>your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly</strong>.
        <span class="v-num">7</span>In praying, don’t use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
        <span class="v-num">8</span>Therefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him.
        <span class="v-num">9</span>Pray like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">10</span><strong>Let your Kingdom come.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">11</span>Give us today our daily bread.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">12</span>Forgive us our debts,
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">13</span>Bring us not into temptation,
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">13</span>For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.’‡ NU omits “For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">14</span>“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
        <span class="v-num">15</span>But if you don’t forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">16</span>“Moreover when you fast, don’t be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
        <span class="v-num">17</span>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
        <span class="v-num">18</span>so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by <strong>your Father who is in secret</strong>; and <strong>your Father who sees in secret will reward you</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">19</span>“Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
        <span class="v-num">20</span>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don’t break through and steal;
        <span class="v-num">21</span>for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">22</span>“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
        <span class="v-num">23</span>But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">24</span>“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. <strong>You can’t serve both God and Mammon.</strong>
        <span class="v-num">25</span>Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
        <span class="v-num">26</span>See the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you of much more value than they?
        <span class="v-num">27</span>“Which of you by being anxious, can add one moment§ literally, cubit to his lifespan?
        <span class="v-num">28</span>Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin,
        <span class="v-num">29</span>yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.
        <span class="v-num">30</span>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">31</span>“Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’
        <span class="v-num">32</span>For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
        <span class="v-num">33</span><strong>But seek first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.</strong>
        <span class="v-num">34</span>Therefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day’s own evil is sufficient.

    <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

    <h3>1) From Temple-Visibility to Father-Union</h3>
    <p>
      Matthew 6 is not a generic “be humble” talk; it’s a direct confrontation with how the temple-age world produced righteousness—through visibility, reputation, and approval inside the religious-social machine. Jesus names the “hypocrites” not as random mean people, but as representatives of a system that trained Israel to perform covenant identity in public. Alms, prayers, fasting—these were real acts, but they were easily weaponized into status. In that environment, righteousness could become theater, and the “reward” was immediate: applause, honor, influence, control. Jesus cuts through that entire economy by anchoring devotion in the Father who is already present and who sees what the public cannot see. This is covenantal movement: the center of gravity is shifting away from temple space and priestly gatekeeping toward direct Father-relationship. That shift is the seed of the New Creation life: access is not earned by performance, and holiness is not managed by spectators; it flows from union.
    </p>

    <h3>2) The “Secret Place” Is Not Hiding—It’s New Covenant Access</h3>
    <p>
      “Your Father who is in secret” is not Jesus promoting spiritual introversion; it’s Jesus announcing the end of a mediated presence model. Under the old order, the “secret” place was bound up with veils and restricted access—holy space for a limited priesthood on a limited schedule. Jesus now tells ordinary disciples to go into an inner room and pray to the Father as Father. That is explosive in covenant terms. It anticipates what will become normal when the old system is retired: the Father is not far, not locked behind ritual machinery, not parceled out by institutional control. The “reward” language is also covenantal: not a prosperity formula, but the Father’s open vindication and provision for those aligned with his kingdom way—especially as the transition intensifies toward AD 70 and the old world’s claims begin to collapse.
    </p>

    <h3>3) “Let Your Kingdom Come” and the First-Century Horizon</h3>
    <p>
      The Lord’s Prayer sits inside the Sermon on the Mount, addressed to disciples living in the overlap of ages. “Let your Kingdom come” is not a vague request for a distant end-of-history event; it belongs to the first-century arrival and manifestation of God’s reign as the Mosaic age reaches its conclusion. The prayer trains disciples to desire what God is doing in their time: the unveiling of the King, the gathering of a renewed people, and the removal of the covenant barriers that had defined Israel’s distance. Read this in covenant transition terms and it becomes coherent: the name of God is being honored in the Son; the will of God is being enacted in the new covenant; daily bread and deliverance are prayed by a people who will face real pressures as the old world shakes; forgiveness is demanded because New Covenant life cannot be lived while clinging to accusation and retaliation—the very spirit of the old order.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Debts, Forgiveness, and the End of Accusation</h3>
    <p>
      Jesus ties prayer to forgiveness with teeth: if you forgive, you’re forgiven; if you don’t, you aren’t. That’s not Jesus re-installing a new legal treadmill; it’s Jesus describing covenant posture during a covenant transition. The old system was powered by accusation—law-defined trespass, debt imagery, and relational fracture. New Covenant life, by contrast, embodies release. If the Messiah is bringing “save his people from their sins,” then his people must live as released people: releasing others, refusing to weaponize trespass, refusing to live by the old economy of scorekeeping. This is why Matthew 6 matters for “fulfilled” theology: it shows what the new world feels like. It is not fear-driven, not performance-driven, not accusation-driven. It is Father-driven—living from the inside out with mercy that matches the covenant you claim to be in.
    </p>

    <h3>5) Treasures, Mammon, and the Shaking of an Old World</h3>
    <p>
      “Don’t lay up treasures on the earth” is commonly individualized into “don’t be materialistic,” but in Matthew’s flow it also functions as survival wisdom for a world nearing upheaval. Israel’s temple-centered society was not stable; it was heading toward judgment and collapse. Treasures could be seized, stolen, burned, confiscated, or rendered useless. Jesus redirects loyalty: invest in what cannot be shaken—“treasures in heaven,” covenant inheritance, kingdom life, Father approval. That’s why the “eye” imagery follows: perception determines what fills you. If your “eye” is evil—if your vision is governed by greed, fear, status, and scarcity—your inner world becomes darkness. Then Jesus states the dividing line: you can’t serve both God and Mammon. Mammon is not simply “money”; it’s wealth as master, wealth as security, wealth as identity. In a covenant transition, serving Mammon ties you to the failing structures of the old world, while serving God anchors you to the unshakable kingdom.
    </p>

    <h3>6) “Don’t Be Anxious” as a Kingdom-Stabilized People</h3>
    <p>
      Anxiety is not merely a mental health topic here; it’s a discipleship marker. Jesus is forming a people who can live calmly while an age is shaking. Birds, lilies, daily provision—these images are not naive. They train a new covenant nervous system: the Father is reliable. The old system made people manage survival through control—status, purity performance, public reputation, hoarding, leverage. Jesus replaces control with trust: seek first the kingdom and righteousness, and the Father supplies what is needed. This is not a promise that nothing difficult ever happens; it’s a promise that the Father’s care is not interrupted by external instability. In first-century terms, this prepares disciples for pressures, persecutions, displacement, and loss. In New Creation terms today, it means your life is not held together by “tomorrow” plans and fear cycles; it is held together by the Father’s presence now.
    </p>

    <h3>7) The Net Result: Righteousness Without Performance, Prayer Without Distance</h3>
    <p>
      Matthew 6 is kingdom formation. It dismantles temple-age righteousness as public theater and installs New Covenant righteousness as relational reality. It trains prayer as communion, not manipulation. It redefines forgiveness as the natural language of a released people. It severs loyalty to Mammon as master and anchors identity in the Father who provides. And because we read this through a fulfilled, first-century resolution, we can say plainly: the transition reached its historical conclusion; the old world that depended on public status, temple leverage, and law-powered accusation is not the governing covenant reality anymore. What remains is the Father’s nearness and the kingdom life of those who live from it.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Where am I still serving “Mammon” (security-by-control) instead of resting in the Father’s nearness and seeking the kingdom first?
