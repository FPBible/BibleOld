<h1>Romans 14</h1>
<h2>Conscience, Freedom, and Welcoming One Another</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Receiving One Another (Romans 14:1–4)</h2>

<p><strong>14:1</strong> Welcome the one who is weak in faith, but not in order to argue over opinions.</p>

<p><strong>14:2–3</strong> One believes he may eat all things, while another eats only vegetables. The one who eats must not despise the one who abstains, and the one who abstains must not judge the one who eats — for God has welcomed him.</p>

<p><strong>14:4</strong> Who are you to judge the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Days and Devotion (Romans 14:5–9)</h2>

<p><strong>14:5–6</strong> One person regards one day above another; another regards every day alike. Each should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day observes it to the Lord, and the one who eats eats to the Lord, giving thanks to God.</p>

<p><strong>14:7–9</strong> None of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself. If we live, we live to the Lord; if we die, we die to the Lord. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Judgment Belongs to the Lord (Romans 14:10–12)</h2>

<p><strong>14:10–11</strong> Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat. As it is written, “Every knee will bow to Me.”</p>

<p><strong>14:12</strong> So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Do Not Destroy for the Sake of Food (Romans 14:13–18)</h2>

<p><strong>14:13</strong> Therefore let us no longer judge one another, but decide instead never to place a stumbling block in a brother’s way.</p>

<p><strong>14:14–15</strong> I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, for him it is unclean. If your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love.</p>

<p><strong>14:16–18</strong> Do not let what you consider good be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Pursue Peace (Romans 14:19–23)</h2>

<p><strong>14:19–20</strong> So then let us pursue what makes for peace and mutual upbuilding. Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food.</p>

<p><strong>14:21–23</strong> It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 14 addresses real tensions in mixed Jewish–Gentile communities.
Dietary practices and sacred days were identity markers under the Law.
Paul reframes them as matters of conscience within a New Creation community.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Community)</h2>

<h3>1) “Weak” and “strong” are covenant positions</h3>
<p>
The “weak” are those still shaped by Law-bound scruples.
The “strong” grasp their freedom in Christ.
Paul does not shame either group; he governs their relationship through love.
</p>

<h3>2) Welcome precedes agreement</h3>
<p>
Unity is not achieved by uniform practice.
God has already welcomed both.
The community mirrors that welcome.
</p>

<h3>3) Clean/unclean categories have ended</h3>
<p>
Paul is explicit: nothing is unclean in itself.
Food laws no longer define holiness.
Love now governs how freedom is exercised.
</p>

<h3>4) Judgment-seat language is covenantal</h3>
<p>
Paul invokes Isaiah to remind believers that God, not peers,
is the judge of covenant standing.
This discourages internal policing during transition.
</p>

<h3>5) The kingdom is relational, not ritual</h3>
<p>
Righteousness, peace, and joy in the Spirit
replace food and calendar observance as covenant markers.
</p>

<h3>6) Faith governs freedom</h3>
<p>
Freedom exercised without regard for conscience
ceases to be faith-filled.
Love limits liberty for the sake of building others up.
</p>

  <li><strong>“Stumbling block”</strong> — harm to conscience during transition.</li>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 14 teaches how freedom and love coexist.
The goal is not proving maturity,
but protecting people.
</p>

<p>
Peace and mutual upbuilding
are the marks of a community that knows condemnation has ended.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be pressing my freedom in a way that harms another’s conscience —
and how does love invite a better path?
</p>
