<h1>Matthew 8</h1>
<h2>Authority, The Inclusion of Nations, and the End of Separation</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/englsv/MAT08.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 8 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
In Matthew 8, Jesus moves from the "Mount of Teaching" into the "Valley of Application." 
He begins to demonstrate that the Kingdom is not merely a set of ethics, but a 
<strong>New Creation authority</strong> that actively dismantles the categories of the Old Covenant.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Leper: Purity is now contagious (8:1–4)</h3>
<p>
As Jesus came down from the mountain, a man with leprosy approached and worshiped Him. 
He said, "Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me."
</p>
<p>
Jesus reached out and touched the man—breaching the Law's barrier. 
"I am willing," He said. "Be cleansed!" Instantly, the leprosy was gone. 
Jesus told him to fulfill the priestly requirements as a final testimony to the priesthood that the New Authority had arrived.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> In the New, the Purity of Christ "infects" the world. Uncleanness no longer has power over the Holy.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Centurion: The Great Transition (8:5–13)</h3>
<p>
A Roman officer approached Jesus, recognizing a higher reality: "Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof. 
Just speak the Word, and it is done. I understand authority."
</p>
<p>
Jesus told the crowd that this Gentile’s faith surpassed everything in Israel. 
He warned that many from the nations would feast with Abraham, while the "sons of the kingdom"—those relying on the old temple system—would be cast into the darkness of their own fading age. 
He told the officer, "Go. It is done as you believed."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> This is a direct prophecy of the AD 70 transition where the Old Covenant lineage was cast out and the Nations were brought in.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Prophetic Weight of Healing (8:14–17)</h3>
<p>
Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law and many others with a word. 
This was the actualization of what Isaiah spoke: "He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Healing is a past-tense, Finished Work reality. He has already carried these things away.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Leaving the Old World behind (8:18–22)</h3>
<p>
To those wanting to follow, Jesus was clear: "The Son of Man has no 'place' in this dying order." 
To the man wanting to wait for a funeral, He said, "Follow Me. Let those who are spiritually dead deal with the dead."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Following Christ requires exiting the maintenance of the old, dead religious structures.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Rest in the midst of Covenant Upheaval (8:23–27)</h3>
<p>
A violent storm rose, but Jesus was at rest. He rebuked the disciples' fear and then the winds. A great calm followed.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Christ’s rest in the storm is our template for living in the transition of worlds.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Judgment of the Legion (8:28–34)</h3>
<p>
Two demoniacs screamed, "Have You come to deal with us before the time?" 
Jesus commanded: "Go!" The demons left, the pigs perished, and the town asked Jesus to leave.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The demons recognized their lease on the old world was expiring with the "end of the age" (AD 70).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The contagion of Life</h3>
<p>
Under the Law, holiness was protected by separation. 
Jesus proves that the New Creation does not fear the "unclean." 
Holiness is now an offensive force.
</p>

<h3>2) The Centurion as a New Covenant model</h3>
<p>
The Centurion trusted the <strong>Authority of the Word</strong> without needing physical signs. 
This is the standard for the Finished Work age.
</p>

<h3>3) The "Outer Darkness" is historical</h3>
<p>
The "weeping and gnashing of teeth" refers to the destruction of the Temple system in AD 70.
</p>

<h3>4) Isaiah 53:4 is a past-tense reality</h3>
<p>
We stand in the reality of what He has already carried away.
