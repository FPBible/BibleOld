<h1>Matthew 25</h1>
<h2>The Parables of Readiness and the Final Separation</h2>

<p class="note">

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus continues His private discourse on the Mount of Olives. After detailing the physical signs of Jerusalem's destruction in chapter 24, He now uses three parables to describe the <strong>spiritual state</strong> of the generation facing that transition.
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>the Kingdom is a matter of internal light, faithful investment of Grace, and the ultimate vindication of those who served the King's "least" during the transition.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Ten Virgins: The Oil of the Spirit (25:1–13)</h3>
<p>
"The Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps to meet the bridegroom. Five were wise and five were foolish. 
The foolish took lamps but no oil; the wise took oil in flasks. When the bridegroom was delayed, they all slept. 
At midnight, the cry went out: 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' 
The foolish begged the wise for oil, but there wasn't enough to share. While they went to buy more, the bridegroom came. 
Those who were ready went into the wedding feast, and the door was shut. 
Later the others came, crying 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' But he replied, 'I do not know you.' Watch, for you do not know the day or the hour."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "oil" is the internal reality of the Holy Spirit. Those relying on the "external lamp" of the Old Covenant rituals found themselves in the dark when the Bridegroom arrived to finalize the New.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Parable of the Talents: Investing the New Life (25:14–30)</h3>
<p>
"It is like a man going on a journey who entrusted his property to his servants—five talents to one, two to another, and one to a third. 
The first two invested and doubled their master’s money. The third buried his talent in the earth out of fear. 
When the master returned, he rewarded the faithful: 'Enter into the joy of your master!' 
But to the one who buried the gift, he said, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew I was a demanding master.' 
He took the talent and gave it to the one with ten, and cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "talents" are the riches of the New Covenant. To bury the talent in the "earth" is to keep the grace of God tied to the "earthly" shadows of the Old system.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Sheep and the Goats: The Judgment of the Nations (25:31–46)</h3>
<p>
"When the Son of Man comes in His glory, He will sit on His throne and all the nations will be gathered. 
He will separate them as a shepherd separates sheep from goats. 
To the sheep on His right, He will say, 'Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you. For I was hungry and you fed Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.' 
They will ask, 'When did we see You like this?' He will reply, 'Whatever you did for the least of My brothers, you did for Me.' 
To those on the left, He will say, 'Depart from Me into the fire prepared for the devil and his messengers. For you did not serve Me in My brothers.' 
These will go into age-abiding punishment, but the righteous into age-abiding life."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> This judgment took place as the Old Age ended. The "brothers" were the Apostles and early believers. How the nations treated the fleeing Christians during the AD 66-70 upheaval revealed their alignment with the King.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Midnight Cry</h3>
<p>
The "delay" of the Bridegroom refers to the forty-year window between the Resurrection and AD 70. 
During this time, many in Israel "fell asleep" or lost interest in the New Covenant. 
The midnight cry was the beginning of the Roman-Jewish war, the final call to enter the safety of the New before the "door" of the Old Covenant was shut forever.
</p>

<h3>2) Entering the Joy of the Master</h3>
<p>
"Entering the joy" is not about going to a distant heaven. 
It is the <strong>Finished Work</strong> reality of inhabiting the New Creation. 
The faithful servants are those who didn't cling to the "dirt" of the Law but traded in the "currency" of Grace.
</p>

<h3>3) The Throne of His Glory</h3>
<p>
Jesus stated in Matt 16:28 that some standing there would see Him coming in His Kingdom. 
The "Throne of His Glory" was established in the first century. 
The judgment of the sheep and goats is the <strong>Covenantal Sorting</strong> that occurred as the Gospel permeated the Roman world (the nations) and the old system was dismantled.
</p>

<h3>4) Serving the "Least of These"</h3>
<p>
In context, the "least of My brothers" refers specifically to the disciples Jesus sent out in Matthew 10. 
As they were persecuted and imprisoned by the old religious establishment, those who helped them were identifying with the King of the New Creation. 
It was a judgment based on **Faith expressed through works** during the transition.
</p>

<h3>5) Age-Abiding (Aionios) Life</h3>
<p>
The Greek word <em>aionios</em> means "pertaining to an age." 
The goats went into the punishment of the *ending* age, while the sheep entered the Life of the *coming* age (the New Covenant). 
Because the New Covenant is the "Final Age," this Life is indeed eternal.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 25 shows that we are the ones who have "oil in our lamps." 
We don't live in the panic of the "foolish" who were left in the dark of the old system. 
We have entered the **Joy of the Master**. 
The separation is complete; we are the "sheep" of His pasture, living in the "age-abiding Life" that Christ secured. 
We serve others not to "earn" a place, but because we are already seated with Him on His throne.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to "buy oil" from a religious system that has already been shut?
</p>
<p>
Do I see the "least of these" through the eyes of the Finished Work, recognizing Christ in my brothers and sisters?
</p>
