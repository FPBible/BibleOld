<h1>John 5</h1>
<h2>Life and Judgment in the Son</h2>

<p>
Jesus enters Jerusalem and heals a man who had lived for decades in weakness.
The sign is performed on the Sabbath, immediately exposing the tension between
life-giving power and a system built on regulation rather than restoration.
</p>

<h3>The Sign: Life Interrupts a Death-Bound System</h3>

<p>
Jesus does not ask permission.
He does not appeal to temple authority.
He speaks life — and a man rises and walks.
The sign is not merely compassionate;
it is confrontational.
It exposes a system that can observe suffering
without possessing the power to heal it.
</p>

<p>
The Sabbath controversy that follows is not about timing.
It is about authority.
By healing on the Sabbath, Jesus declares that
the life of God is not bound to the old covenant structure.
Life now flows directly from the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm">(John 5:1–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Son Shares the Father’s Work</h3>

<p>
Jesus responds to opposition by revealing His identity:
“My Father is working until now, and I am working.”
The claim is staggering.
He places Himself within the divine activity,
not as a servant of the system,
but as the source of its fulfillment.
</p>

<p>
The conflict intensifies because Jesus does not merely
reinterpret the law —
He transcends it.
He reveals that the Father’s work
is the giving of life,
and that this life is now present in the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm">(John 5:16–18)</a>
</p>

<h3>Life Given Now</h3>

<p>
Jesus makes a decisive statement:
whoever hears His word and trusts the One who sent Him
<em>has</em> eternal life.
Such a person does not move toward life later;
they have already crossed from death into life.
</p>

<p>
This is not future hope language.
It is present reality.
Life is not postponed.
It is received.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm">(John 5:24)</a>
</p>

  <strong>Clarification — Life and Resurrection in John 5</strong><br />
  John presents resurrection language covenantally.
  “Death” refers to separation from God’s life within a failing covenant system.
  “Life” refers to participation in the Son here and now.
  Jesus is not outlining a delayed end-of-world scenario,
  but announcing life breaking into a death-bound order.<br /><br />
  See:
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/ezekiel37.html">Ezekiel 37 — Resurrection as Restoration</a> |
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15 — Resurrection and Victory</a>
</div>

<h3>“The Hour Is Coming — and Now Is”</h3>

<p>
Jesus speaks of an hour when the dead hear the voice of the Son of God —
and live.
Crucially, He adds: “and now is.”
This is not prediction alone;
it is announcement.
</p>

<p>
The authority to give life belongs to the Son,
just as the Father possesses life in Himself.
Life is no longer mediated through temple,
sacrifice, or priesthood.
It is encountered directly in Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm">(John 5:25–26)</a>
</p>

<h3>Judgment as Exposure</h3>

<p>
Jesus also speaks of judgment —
not as a distant tribunal,
but as a present unveiling.
Light reveals what already is.
Those aligned with the Son step into life;
those who resist Him remain in death.
</p>

<p>
Judgment, in John, is relational and covenantal.
It is not postponed to the end of history.
It is the necessary result of encountering the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm">(John 5:27–29)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Judgment in John</strong><br />
  Judgment is presented as present and covenantal —
  the exposure of darkness by the arrival of light.
  It is not framed as a future courtroom event,
  but as the consequence of rejecting or receiving life in the Son.
</div>

<h3>Witnesses to the Son</h3>

<p>
Jesus appeals to witnesses —
John the Baptist,
His works,
the Father’s testimony,
and the Scriptures themselves.
Each points beyond the old order
toward life embodied in Him.
</p>

<p>
Yet those most devoted to the Scriptures
miss the very One they testify about.
In clinging to the text while rejecting its fulfillment,
they remain in death.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm">(John 5:31–47)</a>
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
John 5 reveals that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Life is present in the Son, not postponed</li>
  <li>Resurrection language describes covenant transition</li>
  <li>Judgment is exposure, not delay</li>
  <li>The old system cannot mediate life</li>
  <li>Christ Himself is the locus of New Creation life</li>
</ul>
