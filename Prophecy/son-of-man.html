<h1>Son of Man</h1>
<h2>Covenant Authority, Vindication, and Rule</h2>

<p>
“Son of Man” is not a vague title meaning “human being,”
nor is it primarily a statement about Jesus’ humility.
In Scripture, it is a loaded covenant term drawn directly from Israel’s prophetic imagination,
especially Daniel 7.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) The Source: Daniel 7</h2>

<p>
The defining background for “Son of Man” is Daniel 7.
Daniel sees oppressive beastly kingdoms rise and fall,
followed by a courtroom scene in which judgment is rendered.
After the judgment of the beasts,
one like a Son of Man comes <em>to</em> the Ancient of Days.
</p>

<p>
This figure is not coming down to earth.
He is coming into the divine council to receive authority.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>dominion is given to Him</li>
  <li>His kingdom is everlasting</li>
  <li>the saints share in His rule</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is enthronement language,
not travel language.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) Authority, Not Geography</h2>

<p>
Modern readings often assume “coming” language refers to physical movement through space.
Biblically, “coming” frequently refers to the exercise of authority,
especially in judgment or vindication.
</p>

<p>
In Daniel 7, the Son of Man does not descend to earth.
He ascends to receive kingship.
This is the pattern Jesus repeatedly invokes.
</p>

<p>
When Jesus calls Himself “the Son of Man,”
He is not merely saying “I am human.”
He is claiming the Danielic role of the one who receives the kingdom.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Jesus’ Use of the Title</h2>

<p>
Jesus uses “Son of Man” more than any other title for Himself.
He does so strategically,
often in contexts of authority, judgment, and vindication.
</p>

<p>
Key features of Jesus’ usage:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins</li>
  <li>the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath</li>
  <li>the Son of Man will be seen seated at the right hand of Power</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are not future guesses.
They are present claims that place Jesus inside Daniel 7’s courtroom vision.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) “You Will See the Son of Man”</h2>

<p>
Jesus tells the high priest:
“You will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power
and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
</p>

<p>
This is not a prediction about a distant generation.
It is a direct warning to the existing leadership.
</p>

<p>
“Seeing” here means recognising —
through events —
that authority has shifted.
The destruction of Jerusalem and the collapse of the temple system
function as historical vindication of Jesus’ claim.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Clouds, Judgment, and Vindication</h2>

<p>
“Coming on the clouds” is stock prophetic imagery.
In the Hebrew Scriptures,
YHWH “comes on the clouds” when He judges nations and systems.
</p>

<p>
It does not describe meteorology.
It describes divine action within history.
</p>

<p>
When Jesus applies this language to Himself,
He is identifying as the one through whom covenant judgment is executed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) Son of Man and the Saints</h2>

<p>
In Daniel 7,
the Son of Man receives the kingdom,
but the saints possess it.
</p>

<p>
This is crucial.
The Son of Man is not a solitary ruler detached from His people.
His authority is shared.
His reign forms a community.
</p>

<p>
This is why the New Testament consistently speaks of believers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>reigning with Christ</li>
  <li>seated with Him</li>
  <li>participating in His life and authority</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>7) Fulfillment, Not Delay</h2>

<p>
The Son of Man vision is not left open-ended in the New Testament.
It is announced as fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
Jesus is enthroned.
Judgment is executed.
The old covenant order is dismantled.
A new, unshakeable kingdom is established.
</p>

<p>
The question Scripture presses is not:
“When will the Son of Man come?”
but:
“Will you recognise His authority?”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
“Son of Man” is covenant kingship language.
It announces enthronement, vindication, and shared rule —
not a delayed return scenario.
</p>

<p>
Jesus uses the title to declare that the kingdom has been handed to Him,
that judgment belongs to Him,
and that a new order is now in effect.
