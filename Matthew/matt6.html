<h1>Matthew 6</h1>
<h2>Kingdom Practices</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Having established the superior righteousness of the Kingdom (internal vs. external), Jesus now attacks the religious performance of the day. He warns against practicing piety to be seen by the "Old Order"—the synagogue and the street corners. He then pivots to the specific anxiety of the coming transition. With the Roman war on the horizon, hoarding earthly treasure was a foolish strategy; only investment in the coming Age would survive the fires of AD 70.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> Take heed your kindness not to do before men, to be seen by them, and if not—reward ye have not from your Father who is in the heavens;
    <span class="v-num">2</span> whenever, therefore, thou mayest do kindness, thou mayest not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you, they have their reward!
    <span class="v-num">3</span> But thou, doing kindness, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth,
    <span class="v-num">4</span> that thy kindness may be in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret Himself shall reward thee manifestly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">5</span> And when thou mayest pray, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, because they love in the synagogues, and in the corners of the broad places—standing—to pray, that they may be seen of men; verily I say to you, that they have their reward.
    <span class="v-num">6</span> But thou, when thou mayest pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret shall reward thee manifestly.
    <span class="v-num">7</span> And praying, ye may not use vain repetitions like the nations, for they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard,
    <span class="v-num">8</span> be ye not therefore like to them, for your Father doth know those things that ye have need of before your asking him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">9</span> Thus therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in the heavens! Hallowed be Thy name.
    <span class="v-num">10</span> Thy reign come: Thy will come to pass, as in heaven also on the earth.
    <span class="v-num">11</span> Our appointed bread give us today.
    <span class="v-num">12</span> And forgive us our debts, as also we forgive our debtors.
    <span class="v-num">13</span> And mayest Thou not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil, for Thine is the reign, and the power, and the glory—to the ages. Amen.
    <span class="v-num">14</span> For if ye may forgive men their trespasses He also will forgive you—your Father who is in the heavens;
    <span class="v-num">15</span> but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">16</span> And when ye may fast, be not as the hypocrites, of sour countenances, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men fasting; verily I say to you, that they have their reward.
    <span class="v-num">17</span> But thou, fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face,
    <span class="v-num">18</span> that thou mayest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret shall reward thee.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">19</span> Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust disfigure, and where thieves break through and steal,
    <span class="v-num">20</span> but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth disfigure, and where thieves do not break through nor steal,
    <span class="v-num">21</span> for where your treasure is, there will be also your heart.
    <span class="v-num">22</span> The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, thine eye may be perfect, all thy body shall be light,
    <span class="v-num">23</span> but if thine eye may be evil, all thy body shall be dark; if, therefore, the light that is in thee is darkness—the darkness, how great!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">24</span> None is able to serve two lords, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or one he will hold to, and of the other he will be heedless; ye are not able to serve God and Mammon.
    <span class="v-num">25</span> Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat, and what ye may drink, nor for your body, what ye may put on. Is not the life more than the nourishment, and the body than the clothing?
    <span class="v-num">26</span> Look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they?
    <span class="v-num">27</span> And who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age one cubit?
    <span class="v-num">28</span> And about clothing why are ye anxious? Consider well the lilies of the field; how do they grow? They do not labor, nor do they spin;
    <span class="v-num">29</span> and I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
    <span class="v-num">30</span> And if the herb of the field, that today is, and tomorrow is cast to the furnace, God doth so clothe—not much more you, O ye of little faith?
    <span class="v-num">31</span> Therefore ye may not be anxious, saying, What may we eat? Or, What may we drink? Or, What may we put round?
    <span class="v-num">32</span> For all these do the nations seek for, for your heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these;
    <span class="v-num">33</span> but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness, and all these shall be added to you.
    <span class="v-num">34</span> Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow shall be anxious for its own things; sufficient for the day is the evil of it.”

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Prayer Has Been Answered</h3>
<p>
For centuries, the church has prayed "Thy Kingdom Come" as a futuristic hope, ignoring the fact that God answered this prayer in the first century. The "Reign" (Kingdom) was "at hand" when Jesus taught this. It came with power at Pentecost and was fully established when the Old Covenant Temple (the rival kingdom) was destroyed in AD 70. We do not pray for the Kingdom to arrive; we pray from within the Kingdom that is already here. We are the citizens of the answered prayer.
</p>

<h3>2) Bad Investments in a Dying Age</h3>
<p>
Jesus' warning about "treasures on earth" (literally "the Land") was practical investment advice for the AD 30-70 generation. The Jewish economy, the Temple bank, and the land values of Judea were about to be wiped out by the Roman legions. "Moth and rust" refer to the decay of the Old Order; "thieves" hints at the zealots and robbers who seized property during the siege. To store up treasure in the Jerusalem of that day was to lose everything. The only safe investment was in the "Heavens"—the spiritual Kingdom that Rome could not touch.
</p>

<h3>3) Anxiety in the Face of War</h3>
<p>
The command "Be not anxious" (v. 25) must be read in the context of the coming crisis. The disciples would soon face persecution, famine (Acts 11:28), and the tribulation of the "End of the Age." Jesus assures them that while the Gentiles (the nations) scramble for resources, the Father will sustain the "Little Flock" through the transition. This was a promise of survival for the Remnant during the death throes of the Old Covenant.
</p>

<h3>4) Serving Mammon or Messiah?</h3>
<p>
"Mammon" was not just money; it was the entire system of reliance on earthly security. For a first-century Jew, reliance on the Temple system and social standing was reliance on Mammon. Jesus demands a binary choice: You cannot hold onto the Old Covenant status (which brings earthly security) and the New Covenant Kingdom (which brings persecution) at the same time. You must choose which Master you will serve before the judgment falls.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
We do not live in the "anxiety of the transition" that the disciples faced. The war is over. The Kingdom is established. The "Evil One" of that age has been defeated. We can seek the Kingdom not as a desperate lifeboat, but as a settled homeland. Our treasure is safe because our City (New Jerusalem) can never be besieged or destroyed.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I praying "Thy Kingdom Come" like a beggar waiting for a future scrap, or am I living "Thy Kingdom Is Here" like a son enjoying the Father's table?
