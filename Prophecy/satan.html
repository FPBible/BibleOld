<h1>Satan</h1>
<h2>The Adversary as Accuser and Covenant Opponent</h2>

<p class="note">
“Satan” is a title, not a personal name.
It means “adversary” or “accuser.”
Scripture uses it functionally, not mythologically.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Satan in the Hebrew Scriptures</h2>

<p>
In the Old Testament, “the satan” appears as an accuser within God’s court
(Job 1–2; Zech 3).
It is not a rebel deity.
It operates within the covenant framework as a prosecuting role.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Satan in the Gospels</h2>

<p>
In the Gospels, Satan represents the **accusatory power**
working through religious leadership,
law-keeping identity,
and resistance to Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Jesus confronts Satan not by exorcising a cosmic being,
but by exposing and dismantling the system of accusation,
condemnation, and death.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. “The Ruler of This World”</h2>

<p>
Jesus says the ruler of this world is being judged and cast out (John 12).
This refers to the authority structure
rooted in the old covenant order.
</p>

<p>
Satan’s power depends on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>law</li>
  <li>accusation</li>
  <li>condemnation</li>
  <li>fear of death</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the law’s authority ends,
the accuser loses his standing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. The Defeat of Satan</h2>

<p>
The New Testament consistently places Satan’s defeat
within the ministry of Jesus and the early church:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the strong man is bound</li>
  <li>authority is taken away</li>
  <li>accusation is silenced</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not postponed to the end of time.
It is tied to the cross,
the resurrection,
and the removal of the old covenant system.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
“Satan” names the adversarial, accusatory power
embedded in a covenant system that condemned humanity.
That power was exposed, judged, and disarmed in Christ.
