    <h1>Matthew 8 — Kingdom Authority and Covenant Signs</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
    <p>
      After the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus immediately demonstrates covenant authority in action: he heals, cleanses, commands storms and spirits, and exposes who truly belongs to the Kingdom—signs that the old order is being displaced and a new authority is already operating in Israel.
    </p>

    <h2>Scripture (WEB)</h2>
    <div class="scripture-text">
      <p>
        <span class="v-num">1</span>When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
        <span class="v-num">2</span>Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
        <span class="v-num">3</span>Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
        <span class="v-num">4</span>Jesus said to him, “See that you tell nobody; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">5</span>When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help,
        <span class="v-num">6</span>saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”
        <span class="v-num">7</span>Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”
        <span class="v-num">8</span>The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
        <span class="v-num">9</span>For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
        <span class="v-num">10</span>When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel.
        <span class="v-num">11</span><strong>I tell you that many will come from the east and the west</strong>, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,
        <span class="v-num">12</span><strong>but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness</strong>. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
        <span class="v-num">13</span>Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">14</span>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
        <span class="v-num">15</span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. So she got up and served him.†
        <span class="v-num">16</span>When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,
        <span class="v-num">17</span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">18</span>Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.
        <span class="v-num">19</span>A scribe came and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
        <span class="v-num">20</span>Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
        <span class="v-num">21</span>Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
        <span class="v-num">22</span>But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">23</span>When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
        <span class="v-num">24</span>Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves; but he was asleep.
        <span class="v-num">25</span>The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”
        <span class="v-num">26</span>He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
        <span class="v-num">27</span>The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="v-num">28</span>When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,‡ two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.
        <span class="v-num">29</span>Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? <strong>Have you come here to torment us before the time?</strong>”
        <span class="v-num">30</span>Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
        <span class="v-num">31</span>The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
        <span class="v-num">32</span>He said to them, “Go!”
        <span class="v-num">33</span>They came out and went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water.
        <span class="v-num">34</span>Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
        <span class="v-num">35</span>Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.

    <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

    <h3>1) Signs After the Sermon: Authority Made Visible</h3>
    <p>
      Matthew’s order is deliberate: teaching first, then authority displayed. Matthew 5–7 is not abstract ethics; it is covenant confrontation. Then Matthew 8 shows what it looks like when the King is actually present: bodies are restored, storms obey, spirits flee, and social-religious boundaries are re-mapped around Jesus. In a Full Preterist frame, this matters because the AD 30–70 period is a covenant transition: the old “heaven and earth” arrangement (temple-centered access, priestly management of clean/unclean, boundary markers of who belongs) is being displaced. The miracles are not party tricks; they are legal demonstrations. Jesus is showing Israel, in public, that the promised restoration is arriving in him—meaning the old system is on borrowed time.
    </p>

    <h3>2) The Leper: Cleansing Beyond the System</h3>
    <p>
      The leper scene is covenant-loaded. Leprosy is not just sickness; it is uncleanness that excludes. Under Moses, priests could inspect and pronounce, but they could not cleanse. Jesus does what the system cannot: he touches and makes clean. Then he sends the man to the priest “as a testimony to them.” That line is sharp. It is not merely “follow the rules”; it is a witness against the priesthood that the cleansing power of God is now operating outside their control. This is how covenant transition works: the old order is confronted using its own categories. The priest is forced to face a living reality that undermines the entire logic of mediated access. The Kingdom is not a theory; it is cleansing in real time.
    </p>

    <h3>3) The Centurion: Faith, Authority, and Covenant Reversal</h3>
    <p>
      The centurion understands authority—“just say the word.” Jesus responds by contrasting faith in a Gentile officer with unbelief inside Israel. Then comes the explosive announcement: “many will come from the east and the west” to sit with the patriarchs, while “the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness.” That is covenant reversal language. It does not mean “God hates Jews”; it means covenant membership is being redefined around Messiah, not lineage or temple proximity. During the first-century crisis, many who assumed “we’re safe because we’re the inside group” would find themselves excluded from the Kingdom reality because they rejected the King. “Outer darkness” is not Jesus changing topics to a post-mortem torture lecture; it is the imagery of exclusion and loss during the coming upheaval, where the old order’s lights go out and what remains is weeping—because the thing they trusted is collapsing.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Peter’s House and Isaiah 53: Fulfillment as Public Evidence</h3>
    <p>
      Matthew explicitly quotes Isaiah 53:4: “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.” In Matthew’s narrative, fulfillment is not vague; it is observable. The Servant’s burden-bearing is manifested as the King takes sickness and oppression out of the community. This is important for your project because “fulfillment” must not be understated: Matthew is telling the reader, “this is that.” The healings function as covenant proof that restoration is arriving with the Servant-King. It also frames the transition: as the Servant bears what Israel could not bear, he is also preparing the ground for the removal of the old condemnation framework and the establishment of New Creation access.
    </p>

    <h3>5) The Cost of Following: Leaving the Old Priorities Behind</h3>
    <p>
      Two would-be followers appear, and Jesus responds with jarring clarity. “The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head” is not poverty-romanticizing; it is a statement about where security is located during a covenant crisis. Messiah is not anchoring identity in the stable “old world”; he is moving through Israel on a mission that will culminate in judgment and renewal. “Leave the dead to bury their own dead” is not cold-heartedness; it is prophetic urgency: during transition, old-life obligations cannot be allowed to outrank allegiance to the King. This is how Jesus pulls people out of the doomed house and into the unshakable one.
    </p>

    <h3>6) Storm and Sea: Chaos Under Covenant Command</h3>
    <p>
      The sea in biblical imagination often carries chaos/hostility imagery. Jesus rebukes wind and sea, and calm follows. This is not merely “nature miracle”; it is a kingdom sign: the One who teaches with authority also rules the forces humans cannot tame. In the covenant-litigation flow of Matthew, it reinforces that the coming shake-up will not dethrone him. The old structures can collapse; the King remains. That’s New Creation stability: not “no storms,” but an authority that is not threatened by them.
    </p>

    <h3>7) Tombs and Demons: Uncleanness Driven Out, “Before the Time” Explained</h3>
    <p>
      The demonic scene sits in unclean territory: tombs, fierce oppression, and pigs. The point is boundary-crossing authority: Jesus drives out what dominates people. The demons’ question—“Have you come here to torment us before the time?”—is key for a fulfilled lens. It assumes an appointed schedule. That schedule, in Matthew’s world, is tied to the covenant transition climax (AD 30–70): the authoritative overthrow of the old powers tied to Israel’s corrupted leadership and the coming national judgment. “Before the time” is not “Jesus might come back thousands of years later”; it is “this is moving faster than we expected.” The scene anticipates that the kingdom invasion is accelerating toward a decisive first-century resolution.
    </p>

    <h3>8) The City Begs Him to Leave: Israel’s Pattern Replayed</h3>
    <p>
      The ending is haunting: the city comes out and begs Jesus to depart. That is a micro-parable of Israel’s wider reaction to the King. When the Kingdom disrupts economic and social comfort (pigs lost, status challenged, control threatened), many prefer distance over deliverance. Matthew is showing you, again, the covenant divide: the presence of God is arriving, and the question is not “is it powerful?” but “will you receive it?” In the first century, that question carried immediate consequences as the old world rushed toward its collapse.

      Where am I asking Jesus to “depart from my borders” because his presence disrupts something I’m still using as comfort or control?
