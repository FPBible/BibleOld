      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        In Chapter 5, the Lamb took the sealed scroll—the covenantal decree of divorce and judgment against apostate Israel, and the title deed to the New Creation. In Chapter 6, the Lamb begins to break the seals, releasing the divine decree into human history. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What follows is not a random assortment of futuristic global terrors. The first four seals (the famous "Four Horsemen") are the precise, legally-mandated covenant curses outlined in Leviticus 26 and Ezekiel 14 (sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts) poured out upon the unfaithful nation in the first century. This culminates in the Sixth Seal: the total political and religious collapse of the Old Covenant "heavens and earth."

        <span class="v-num">3</span> When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> Another came out, a red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come and see!” And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> I heard a voice in the middle of the four living creatures saying, “A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don’t damage the oil and the wine!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come and see!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on him, his name was Death. Hades followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> They cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”<br />

        <span class="v-num">12</span> I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.<br />

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Four Horsemen (vv. 1-8):</strong> These are not future biological weapons or Russian tanks. They perfectly map to the divine covenant curses God promised to unleash on Israel if they rebelled (Leviticus 26, Ezekiel 14). They played out historically during the violent buildup to the Jewish-Roman War (AD 66-70), which featured massive foreign invasion (Rome), devastating civil war within Judea, and the brutal famine inside the besieged city of Jerusalem.</li>
        <li><strong>The Martyrs' Time-Frame (v. 11):</strong> The martyrs are told to rest "yet for a while" (a little longer). Their vindication was imminent, not scheduled for 2,000+ years in the future. They were waiting for the final wave of Neronian persecution to finish before God dropped the hammer on the persecuting powers.</li>
        <li><strong>De-Creation Language (vv. 12-14):</strong> The sun turning black and stars falling is standard Old Testament apocalyptic idiom for the political collapse of a nation's government and priesthood, not the end of the physical universe.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>balance in his hand</strong> — A scale used for rationing food during extreme famine (Ezekiel 4:16). A denarius was a full day's wage; a choenix of wheat was a single daily ration. It indicates devastating hyper-inflation where a man works all day just to buy enough bread for himself, leaving his family starving.</li>
        <li><strong>underneath the altar</strong> — In the Old Covenant sacrificial system, the blood of the sacrifice was poured out at the base of the altar. The martyrs' lives were poured out as a sacrifice for the Gospel.</li>
        <li><strong>stars of the sky fell</strong> — In biblical symbolism (Genesis 37), stars represent governing authorities, princes, and leaders falling from their positions of power.</li>
        <li><strong>hid themselves in the caves</strong> — A direct fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy on the way to the cross (Luke 23:30). During the final Roman siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, the Jewish rebel leaders literally fled into the subterranean caverns and sewer systems beneath the city to hide from the Roman army.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Four Horsemen: Covenant Lawsuit Enforced (vv. 1–8)</h3>
      <p>
        The Four Horsemen are a terrifying image, but they are not arbitrary. In Ezekiel 14:21, God declares His "four severe judgments" against unfaithful Jerusalem: sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague. John is witnessing the exact execution of that ancient covenantal contract. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Jewish nation officially rejected their Messiah, saying "We have no king but Caesar" (John 19:15), God gave them over to the consequences. 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>White Horse (Conquest):</strong> The Roman war machine marching on Judea.</li>
          <li><strong>Red Horse (War/Bloodshed):</strong> The total breakdown of peace. Between AD 66 and 70, Judea descended into horrific civil war. Zealot factions slaughtered each other in the streets of Jerusalem even before the Romans breached the walls.</li>
          <li><strong>Black Horse (Famine):</strong> During the siege of Jerusalem, food became so scarce that citizens ate leather, belts, and tragically, even their own children, exactly as Moses had warned in Deuteronomy 28:53.</li>
          <li><strong>Pale Horse (Death):</strong> The inevitable result of siege warfare—mass starvation, disease, and corpses left unburied for the animals.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Cry for Justice (vv. 9–11)</h3>
      <p>
        The Fifth Seal shifts from earth to heaven. The souls under the altar cry out, "How long, Master... until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth [the Land]?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        Why are they crying out for vengeance against "the Land" (Judea)? Jesus explicitly warned the Pharisees in Matthew 23:35 that <em>"on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth... All these things will come upon <strong>this generation</strong>."</em> The first-century apostate Jewish system had murdered the Old Testament prophets, crucified the Lord of Glory, and was currently hunting down the Apostles. God tells the martyrs to wait just "a little while." The judgment of AD 70 is only moments away.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Sixth Seal: De-Creation (vv. 12–14)</h3>
      <p>
        If you read verses 12-14 with a modern scientific mindset, you will think the literal solar system is collapsing. But John is a Hebrew prophet writing to people steeped in the Old Testament. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When Isaiah prophesied the destruction of Babylon (Isa 13:10), he said the sun, moon, and stars would go dark. When Ezekiel prophesied the fall of Egypt (Ezek 32:7), he used the exact same imagery. <strong>Cosmic collapse is the biblical idiom for the overthrow of a government and its religious system.</strong> The "sun" (the High Priest/Sanhedrin) is going dark. The "stars" (the rulers and rabbis) are falling from power. The political "heavens" of the Old Covenant are being rolled up like a scroll. 
      </p>

      <h3>4) Hiding in the Caves (vv. 15–17)</h3>
      
      <p>
        The terror of the apostate leaders is profound. They do not cry out to God for mercy; they cry out to the rocks to crush them to escape the "wrath of the Lamb."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an incredible historical fulfillment. In Luke 23:30, as Jesus was being led to the cross, He turned to the weeping women of Jerusalem and warned them of the coming siege, saying, <em>"Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and the hills, 'Cover us!'"</em> In AD 70, when the Roman army finally broke through the impregnable walls of Jerusalem, the Jewish tyrants and zealot leaders literally abandoned their fortresses and fled into the subterranean caves and sewers beneath the city, begging for death rather than capture. The great day of His wrath upon the Old Covenant had come.

      <h2>8. New Creation Reality</h2>
      <p>
        Many modern Christians read Revelation 6 with terrible anxiety, wondering if they will have to suffer through the Four Horsemen or hide from falling stars. But because we read this through the lens of fulfilled covenant history, we know the truth: <strong>You are not waiting for the wrath of the Lamb; you are living in the wake of His absolute victory.</strong> The old, corrupt, persecuting system was dismantled. The martyrs received their justice. The violent shaking of the heavens and earth is finished, leaving us safely planted in the unshakable Kingdom of God.
