<h1>John 3</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.<br/>
The same came to him by night, and said to him, â€œRabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.â€<br/>
Jesus answered him, â€œMost certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he canâ€™t see Godâ€™s Kingdom.â€<br/>
Nicodemus said to him, â€œHow can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his motherâ€™s womb, and be born?â€<br/>
Jesus answered, â€œMost certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he canâ€™t enter into Godâ€™s Kingdom.<br/>
That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<br/>
Donâ€™t marvel that I said to you, â€˜You must be born anew.â€™<br/>
The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but donâ€™t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.â€<br/>
Nicodemus answered him, â€œHow can these things be?â€<br/>
Jesus answered him, â€œAre you the teacher of Israel, and donâ€™t understand these things?<br/>
Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you donâ€™t receive our witness.<br/>
If I told you earthly things and you donâ€™t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?<br/>
No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.<br/>
As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,<br/>
that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br/>
For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br/>
For God didnâ€™t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.<br/>
He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesnâ€™t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.<br/>
This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.<br/>
For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesnâ€™t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.<br/>
But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.â€<br/>
After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them and baptized.<br/>
John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized;<br/>
for John was not yet thrown into prison.<br/>
Therefore a dispute arose on the part of Johnâ€™s disciples with some Jews about purification.<br/>
They came to John and said to him, â€œRabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.â€<br/>
John answered, â€œA man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.<br/>
You yourselves testify that I said, â€˜I am not the Christ,â€™ but, â€˜I have been sent before him.â€™<br/>
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroomâ€™s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.<br/>
He must increase, but I must decrease.<br/>
He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.<br/>
What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.<br/>
He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.<br/>
For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.<br/>
The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.<br/>
One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son wonâ€™t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.â€

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, in dialogue with Nicodemus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> First-century Israel, represented by a Pharisaic leader</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> Transition from old covenant birth (flesh, lineage, Law) to new covenant birth (Spirit)</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Israelâ€™s leadership was being told that entry into Godâ€™s kingdom required a complete covenant rebirth, not reform.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) Nicodemus represents old covenant Israel</h3>
<p>He is sincere, learned, and devout â€” yet still blind to the nature of the kingdom. Jesus is not correcting Nicodemusâ€™ morality, but his covenant .</p>
<h3>2) â€œBorn from aboveâ€ is covenant language</h3>
<p>This is not about repeating individual conversion experiences. It is prophetic language for Israelâ€™s promised renewal by the Spirit.</p>
<h3>3) New Birth is National Resurrection Language (Ezekiel 36-37)</h3>
<p>When Jesus tells Nicodemus he must be "born from above," He is not inventing new doctrine â€” He is announcing the fulfillment of Israel's ancient prophetic hope. Ezekiel 36-37 promised that God would give Israel a new heart, put His Spirit within them, and raise them from the grave of covenant death.</p>
<p>"I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean... I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you" (Ezek 36:25-26). This is the "water and Spirit" Jesus references in John 3:5. It's not baptism plus personal conversion â€” it's national covenant renewal through cleansing and Spirit.</p>
<p>Ezekiel 37 goes further: God shows the prophet a valley of dry bones and says, "These bones are the whole house of Israel" (v. 11). Then God promises, "I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land" (v. 14). This is resurrection language applied to a people under covenant death, not individuals in biological graves.</p>
<p>So when Jesus says "you must be born again," He is announcing that this prophetic resurrection has arrived. Israel's long-awaited regeneration is happening through Him. The individual experience of new birth is entry into this corporate reality â€” becoming part of the people whom God has raised from covenant death to covenant life.</p>
<p>Nicodemus should have understood this. As a teacher of Israel, he was familiar with Ezekiel's prophecies. Jesus rebukes him for missing it (v. 10): How can you be Israel's teacher and not recognize that the resurrection of the nation is unfolding before you?</p>
<h3>4) What ended</h3>
<p>Flesh-based identity, ethnic privilege, Law-defined righteousness, and temple-mediated access to God were all passing away.</p>
<h3>5) What replaced it</h3>
<p>A Spirit-birthed people, defined by faithfulness to Christ and indwelt by Godâ€™s presence.</p>
<h3>6) The bronze serpent explains the cross</h3>
<p>As Israel looked and lived, so now Israel would trust and live. The lifting up of the Son would deal decisively with covenant death.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This new birth began during Jesusâ€™ ministry, was secured through the cross and resurrection, and publicly confirmed as the old covenant order collapsed in AD 70.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>You do not enter Godâ€™s life by heritage, effort, or religious knowledge. You live because God has already brought forth a new people by His Spirit. Life in Christ is not reform â€” it is rebirth.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>If new birth is a finished covenant reality, where are you still trying to qualify for life that has already been given?</p>
