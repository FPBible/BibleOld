<h2>Matthew 1: The Genealogy and Birth of the King</h2>

<h3>Immediate Context</h3>
<p>Matthew opens his Gospel with a carefully structured genealogy tracing Jesus through the royal line of David. This was not mere historical record but a covenantal declaration: the promised Messiah-King has arrived to fulfill God's ancient promises to Israel. The virgin birth narrative establishes Jesus as both fully human (through Mary) and divinely appointed (conceived by the Holy Spirit). Matthew's original Jewish audience would immediately recognize the significance—this is the one who will save His people from their sins and establish the new covenant.</p>

<h3>Scripture: Matthew 1 (LSV)</h3>
<div class="scripture-text">
<p><span class="v-num">1</span>A scroll of the birth of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham. <span class="v-num">2</span>Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers, <span class="v-num">3</span>and Judah begot Perez and Zerah of Tamar, and Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram, <span class="v-num">4</span>and Ram begot Amminadab, and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon, <span class="v-num">5</span>and Salmon begot Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed of Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse, <span class="v-num">6</span>and Jesse begot David the king. And David the king begot Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah's, <span class="v-num">7</span>and Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa, <span class="v-num">8</span>and Asa begot Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah, <span class="v-num">9</span>and Uzziah begot Jotham, and Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah, <span class="v-num">10</span>and Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah, <span class="v-num">11</span>and Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers, at the Babylonian removal. <span class="v-num">12</span>And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel, <span class="v-num">13</span>and Zerubbabel begot Abiud, and Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor, <span class="v-num">14</span>and Azor begot Sadok, and Sadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud, <span class="v-num">15</span>and Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob, <span class="v-num">16</span>and Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ. <span class="v-num">17</span>All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal to the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>

<p><span class="v-num">18</span>And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: for His mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit, <span class="v-num">19</span>and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, resolved to send her away privately. <span class="v-num">20</span>And on his thinking of these things, behold, a messenger of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, you may not fear to receive your wife Mary, for that which was begotten in her is from [the] Holy Spirit, <span class="v-num">21</span>and she will bring forth a Son, and you will call His Name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." <span class="v-num">22</span>And all this has come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the LORD through the prophet, saying, <span class="v-num">23</span>"Behold, the virgin will conceive, and she will bring forth a Son, and they will call His Name Immanuel," which is, being interpreted, "God with us." <span class="v-num">24</span>And Joseph, having risen from sleep, did as the messenger of the LORD directed him, and received his wife, <span class="v-num">25</span>and did not know her until she brought forth her Son—the firstborn, and he called His Name Jesus.</p>

</div>

<h3>Fulfillment Commentary: The King Arrives</h3>

<h4>1. The Genealogical Proof of Messianic Credentials</h4>
<p>Matthew's genealogy is not arbitrary. It establishes beyond doubt that Jesus is the legal heir to David's throne. From a Full Preterist perspective, this matters immensely because the promises to David were fulfilled in the first century, not in some distant future millennial reign. Jesus is presented as the culmination of Israel's covenantal history. The three sets of fourteen generations mark the progression from promise (Abraham to David), to kingdom (David to exile), to restoration (exile to Christ). This structure demonstrates that Jesus appears at the climax of redemptive history, not to start a multi-thousand-year waiting period, but to immediately inaugurate the Kingdom.</p>

<h4>2. The Virgin Birth and Covenant Transition</h4>
<p>The virgin birth is essential to Full Preterism. Jesus is uniquely qualified to be the Last Adam—born of woman but not of Adam's fallen seed. This miraculous conception signifies a new creation breaking into the old. He is "God with us" not in some distant millennial temple, but in His incarnation, ministry, and ongoing presence through the Spirit in the New Covenant community established by AD 70.</p>

<h4>3. "He Will Save His People from Their Sins"</h4>
<p>This is past-tense salvation from the Full Preterist lens. The Greek construction indicates a completed action with ongoing effects. Jesus did not come to begin a salvation process that continues indefinitely. He came to save His people—the remnant of Israel and the ingrafted Gentiles—from their sins through His atoning death. The removal of sins is tied directly to the removal of the Old Covenant system. Hebrews 9:26 says He appeared "once at the end of the ages" to put away sin. That end came in AD 70 when the temple-based sacrificial system was obliterated, demonstrating that Christ's once-for-all sacrifice had accomplished full atonement.</p>

</ul>

<h3>New Creation Reality</h3>
<p>Because Jesus has come and fulfilled all covenant promises, we live in the reality of Immanuel—God truly with us. The genealogy reminds us that God works through history, not in disconnected dispensational epochs. Every promise made to the fathers has found its "Yes" in Christ. We are not awaiting a future kingdom; we are presently seated with Christ in heavenly places, participating in the New Creation that began with His resurrection and was consummated in AD 70.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>If Jesus is truly "God with us" now through the Spirit, how does that reality change the way you approach prayer, suffering, and mission today?</p>

<h2>Matthew 2: The Flight to Egypt and Return</h2>

<h3>Immediate Context</h3>
<p>The narrative of Jesus' infancy is steeped in Old Testament typology. Herod's murderous rage, the flight to Egypt, and the return to Nazareth all echo Israel's own history. Matthew is showing that Jesus is the true Israel, the faithful Son who will succeed where national Israel failed. The chapter also introduces a critical theme: the rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish leadership, a rejection that will culminate in AD 70.</p>

<h3>Scripture: Matthew 2 (LSV)</h3>
<div class="scripture-text">
<p><span class="v-num">1</span>And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east came to Jerusalem, <span class="v-num">2</span>saying, "Where is He who was born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east, and we came to worship Him." <span class="v-num">3</span>And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him, <span class="v-num">4</span>and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born. <span class="v-num">5</span>And they said to him, "In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet: <span class="v-num">6</span>'And you, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, you are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you will come one leading, who will feed My people Israel.'" <span class="v-num">7</span>Then Herod, having called the magi privately, inquired exactly from them the time of the appearing star, <span class="v-num">8</span>and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, "Having gone, inquire exactly for the Child, and whenever you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come, may worship Him." <span class="v-num">9</span>And they, having heard the king, departed, and behold, the star, that they saw in the east, went before them, until, having come, it stood over where the Child was. <span class="v-num">10</span>And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy, <span class="v-num">11</span>and having come into the house, they found the Child with Mary His mother, and having fallen down, they worshiped Him, and having opened their treasures, they brought to Him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh, <span class="v-num">12</span>and having been divinely warned in a dream not to return to Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region.</p>

<p><span class="v-num">13</span>And on their having withdrawn, behold, a messenger of the LORD appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, "Having risen, take the Child and His mother, and flee to Egypt, and be there until I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the Child to destroy Him." <span class="v-num">14</span>And he, having risen, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt, <span class="v-num">15</span>and he was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the LORD through the prophet, saying, "I called My Son out of Egypt." <span class="v-num">16</span>Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the magi, was very angry, and having sent forth, he slew all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the magi. <span class="v-num">17</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, <span class="v-num">18</span>"A voice in Ramah was heard—weeping and much mourning—Rachel weeping [for] her children, and she did not will to be comforted because they are not." <span class="v-num">19</span>And Herod having died, behold, a messenger of the LORD appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, <span class="v-num">20</span>saying, "Having risen, take the Child and His mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died—those seeking the life of the Child." <span class="v-num">21</span>And he, having risen, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel, <span class="v-num">22</span>and having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee, <span class="v-num">23</span>and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that "He will be called a Nazarene."</p>

<h3>Fulfillment Commentary: Jesus as the True Israel</h3>

<h4>1. The Rejection Motif Begins</h4>
<p>Herod's attempt to kill the infant King sets the tone for the entire Gospel. The political and religious establishment of Jerusalem will consistently reject Jesus, culminating in His crucifixion. From a Full Preterist standpoint, this rejection is not incidental but covenantal. Israel's leadership, representing the Old Covenant system, refuses to recognize their Messiah. This refusal seals their doom. The judgment on Jerusalem in AD 70 is divine vindication—God's wrath poured out on the generation that rejected and killed the Son.</p>

<h4>2. Typological Fulfillment: Jesus Recapitulates Israel's History</h4>
<p>Matthew explicitly connects Jesus to Israel's history through the Hosea 11:1 quotation. Just as Israel was called out of Egypt, so is Jesus. But unlike Israel, who rebelled in the wilderness, Jesus remains faithful. He is the faithful Son, the true Israel who will accomplish what the nation could not. This is not allegory—it is typological fulfillment. The Old Testament narratives were prophetic patterns pointing forward to Christ. When Jesus emerges from Egypt, He is not repeating history; He is fulfilling it. The exodus was a shadow; Jesus is the substance.</p>

<h4>3. Rachel's Weeping and the End of the Old Covenant</h4>
<p>Jeremiah 31:15 originally referred to the Babylonian exile, but Matthew sees Herod's massacre as a fulfillment of this lament. Why? Because both events—exile and infanticide—represent the suffering of Israel under the curse of the broken covenant. Yet Jeremiah 31 goes on to promise the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34). The weeping of Rachel is not the end; it is the birth pang of the New Creation. Herod's slaughter is a dark prelude to the coming judgment, but also to the resurrection and New Covenant inauguration. In AD 70, the old order of weeping and death is finally swept away.</p>

</ul>

<h3>New Creation Reality</h3>
<p>We are not waiting for Jesus to "come out of Egypt" again or to repeat the exodus. Those events are fulfilled. We live in the age where the true Israel—the church—has been called out of bondage (sin and death under the Old Covenant) and brought into the Promised Land (the New Covenant rest). Our task is not to look backward or forward to another fulfillment but to live in the reality of what Christ has already accomplished.</p>

<p>How does understanding Jesus as the faithful Israel change your view of your own identity in Christ and your relationship to the Old Testament promises?</p>

<h2>Matthew 24: The Olivet Discourse—The End of the Age</h2>

<h3>Immediate Context</h3>
<p>After pronouncing woes upon the scribes and Pharisees in chapter 23, Jesus leaves the temple and declares its coming desolation. His disciples ask when these things will happen and what will be the sign of His coming and the end of the age. This chapter is the most critical passage for Full Preterism. Jesus is not describing a distant, future "end of the world" but the imminent end of the Mosaic Age, culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in AD 70. Every detail of this discourse finds its fulfillment within the first-century generation.</p>

<h3>Scripture: Matthew 24 (LSV)</h3>
<div class="scripture-text">
<p><span class="v-num">1</span>And having gone forth, Jesus departed from the temple, and His disciples came near to show Him the buildings of the temple, <span class="v-num">2</span>and Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these? Truly I say to you, there may not be left here a stone on a stone that will not be thrown down." <span class="v-num">3</span>And when He is sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came near to Him by Himself, saying, "Tell us, when will these be? And what [is] the sign of Your coming, and of the full end of the age?" <span class="v-num">4</span>And Jesus answering said to them, "Take heed that no one may lead you astray, <span class="v-num">5</span>for many will come in My Name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray, <span class="v-num">6</span>and you will begin to hear of wars, and reports of wars; see, do not be troubled, for it must happen, but the end is not yet. <span class="v-num">7</span>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in various places; <span class="v-num">8</span>and all these [are the] beginning of sorrows; <span class="v-num">9</span>then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My Name; <span class="v-num">10</span>and then will many be stumbled, and they will deliver up one another, and will hate one another. <span class="v-num">11</span>And many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray; <span class="v-num">12</span>and because of the abounding of the lawlessness, the love of the many will become cold; <span class="v-num">13</span>but he who endured to the end, this one will be saved; <span class="v-num">14</span>and this good news of the Kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then will the end arrive.</p>

<p><span class="v-num">15</span>Whenever, therefore, you may see the abomination of the desolation, that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever is reading let him observe), <span class="v-num">16</span>then those in Judea—let them flee to the mountains; <span class="v-num">17</span>he on the housetop—do not let him come down to take up anything out of his house; <span class="v-num">18</span>and he in the field—do not let him turn back to take his garments. <span class="v-num">19</span>And woe to those with child, and to those nursing in those days; <span class="v-num">20</span>and pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath; <span class="v-num">21</span>for there will then be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor may be. <span class="v-num">22</span>And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would have been saved; but because of the chosen, will those days be shortened. <span class="v-num">23</span>Then if anyone may say to you, Behold, here [is] the Christ! Or, Here! You may not believe; <span class="v-num">24</span>for there will arise false Christs, and false prophets, and they will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, also the chosen. <span class="v-num">25</span>Behold, I have told you beforehand. <span class="v-num">26</span>If therefore they may say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, you may not go forth; behold, in the inner chambers, you may not believe; <span class="v-num">27</span>for as the lightning comes forth from the east, and appears to the west, so will also be the coming of the Son of Man; <span class="v-num">28</span>for wherever the carcass may be, there the eagles will be gathered together.</p>

<p><span class="v-num">29</span>And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; <span class="v-num">30</span>and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky; and then all the tribes of the earth will strike the breast, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and much glory; <span class="v-num">31</span>and He will send His messengers with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His chosen from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends thereof. <span class="v-num">32</span>And from the fig tree learn the allegory: When already its branch may have become tender, and it may put forth the leaves, you know that summer [is] near, <span class="v-num">33</span>so also you, when you may see all these, know that it is near—at the doors. <span class="v-num">34</span>Truly I say to you, this generation may not pass away until all these may come to pass. <span class="v-num">35</span>The sky and the earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. <span class="v-num">36</span>And concerning that day and the hour no one has known—not even the messengers of the heavens—except My Father only; <span class="v-num">37</span>and as the days of Noah—so will be also the coming of the Son of Man; <span class="v-num">38</span>for as they were, in the days before the flood, eating, and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the Ark, <span class="v-num">39</span>and they did not know until the flood came and took all away; so will be also the coming of the Son of Man. <span class="v-num">40</span>Then two men will be in the field: one is received and one is left; <span class="v-num">41</span>two women will be grinding in the mill: one is received and one is left. <span class="v-num">42</span>Watch, therefore, because you have not known in what hour your Lord comes; <span class="v-num">43</span>and know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief comes, he had watched, and did not permit his house to be broken through; <span class="v-num">44</span>because of this also you, become ready, because in what hour you do not think, the Son of Man comes. <span class="v-num">45</span>Who, then, is the servant, faithful and wise, whom his lord appointed over his household, to give them the nourishment in season? <span class="v-num">46</span>Blessed that servant whom his lord, having come, will find doing so; <span class="v-num">47</span>truly I say to you that he will set him over all his substance. <span class="v-num">48</span>But if that evil
