<h1>Isaiah</h1>

<h2>Chapter 11 — The Messiah and the New Humanity</h2>

<h3>The Branch from Jesse</h3>

<p>
A shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse,
and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
The Spirit of the LORD will rest upon Him —
the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the Spirit of counsel and might,
the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
His delight will be in the fear of the LORD.
He will not judge by what His eyes see,
or decide by what His ears hear.
But with righteousness He will judge the poor,
and decide with equity for the meek of the land.
He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth,
and with the breath of His lips He will kill the wicked.
Righteousness will be the belt around His waist,
and faithfulness the belt around His hips.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:3–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>Peace Imagery of a New Order</h3>

<p>
The wolf will dwell with the lamb,
and the leopard will lie down with the young goat;
the calf and the lion and the fattened animal together,
and a little child will lead them.
The cow and the bear will graze,
their young will lie down together,
and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
The nursing child will play near the cobra’s hole,
and the weaned child will put his hand in the viper’s den.
They will not harm or destroy in all My holy mountain,
for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD
as the waters cover the sea.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:6–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Nations Gather to the Root of Jesse</h3>

<p>
In that day the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples.
The nations will seek Him,
and His resting place will be glorious.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>Restoration and Gathering</h3>

<p>
In that day the Lord will again extend His hand
to recover the remnant of His people
from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath,
and the islands of the sea.
He will lift up a banner for the nations
and gather the outcasts of Israel,
and assemble the scattered of Judah
from the four corners of the land.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:11–12)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephraim’s jealousy will depart,
and Judah’s hostility will be cut off.
Ephraim will not envy Judah,
and Judah will not harass Ephraim.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:13)</a>
</p>

<p>
The LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt,
and will wave His hand over the River with scorching wind,
and strike it into seven channels,
so people may cross in sandals.
There will be a highway for the remnant of His people
as there was for Israel in the day they came up from Egypt.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:15–16)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 11</h2>

<h3>1) The “stump of Jesse” is the collapse of old kingship</h3>
<p>
Isaiah sees David’s house reduced to a stump — the glory of the old order cut down.
New Creation does not grow out of a thriving old system.
It rises out of what looks finished.
The Messiah is not an extension of old covenant power;
He is the new beginning that comes from its apparent end.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:1)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) The Spirit resting on Him is covenant leadership redefined</h3>
<p>
This is not charisma for spectacle.
It is wisdom, understanding, counsel, and justice —
leadership that sees deeper than appearances.
Isaiah’s Messiah does not rule by propaganda or perception,
but by truth and righteousness.
This anticipates the New Covenant reality where God’s rule is internal and transforming.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:2–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “Rod of His mouth” points to judgment by word, not by sword</h3>
<p>
The Messiah defeats wickedness through His mouth — through decree, truth, and authoritative speech.
This matters: the kingdom advances by proclamation, not by violence.
Isaiah is already undermining the expectation of a merely military Messiah.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:4)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Wolf and lamb is peace imagery: hostility ended inside the covenant world</h3>
<p>
Isaiah uses creature imagery to portray a world where predation and fear lose their rule.
Read it as prophetic symbolism for reconciled relationships and social transformation,
not a zoological prediction.
It depicts the end of hostility within God’s “holy mountain” —
His covenant domain.
Where the knowledge of the LORD fills the land,
harm is no longer the operating principle.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:6–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) “Holy mountain” is Zion language: a reconstituted people under God’s presence</h3>
<p>
The chapter does not say “the whole planet becomes harmless overnight.”
It locates the transformation “in all My holy mountain.”
Zion is covenant centre, the sphere where God’s rule is embodied.
In New Covenant terms, this becomes the community where Christ reigns and peace is practised.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:9)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) The knowledge of the LORD filling the earth is gospel expansion language</h3>
<p>
Waters covering the sea is saturation imagery.
It’s about permeation and fullness — truth filling a domain.
This aligns with the New Covenant promise of God being known without priestly mediation.
The knowledge spreads because the light spreads.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:9)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) The “banner” signals Gentile inclusion under the Messiah</h3>
<p>
Isaiah is explicit: the nations seek the Root of Jesse.
This is not “Israel-only restoration.”
It is Messiah-centred gathering.
The New Creation is not ethnic expansion; it is Christ-centred unification.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) The “remnant” and gathering language points to restoration through upheaval</h3>
<p>
Isaiah describes a remnant recovered from the nations — exile language.
In fulfilled terms, this anticipates the re-gathering of God’s people into one body
as the old covenant story reaches its crisis and conclusion.
The end goal is not merely return to geography,
but return to covenant life under God’s rule.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:11–12)</a>
</p>

<h3>9) The end of Ephraim/Judah hostility is the prototype of “one new humanity”</h3>
<p>
Isaiah sees internal covenant tribalism cut off.
This is the seed-form of what the New Testament will later proclaim:
hostility put to death; one reconciled people.
If the Messiah reigns, jealousy and rivalry have no legitimacy.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:13)</a>
</p>

<h3>10) New exodus imagery announces a new way through old barriers</h3>
<p>
Drying seas and striking rivers is exodus symbolism.
It means God makes a way where there was none.
In New Covenant terms, the “highway” is access —
a prepared way into covenant life, not a future road-building project.
Isaiah is announcing deliverance by divine initiative.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA11.htm">(Isa 11:15–16)</a>
</p>

<p>
Isaiah 11 is not sentimental poetry.
It is a hard prophetic blueprint:
the old kingship collapses,
a Spirit-anointed Messiah rises,
hostility is dismantled,
the nations are gathered,
and a new covenant domain becomes defined by peace and the knowledge of the LORD.
