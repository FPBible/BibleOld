  <h1>Matthew 1</h1>

  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <p>Matthew opens his account by bridging the gap between the Old Covenant expectations and the New Creation reality. He presents the legal and covenantal lineage of Jesus Christ, establishing Him as the legitimate heir to the Davidic throne and the ultimate seed of Abraham, set against the backdrop of the impending transition from the shadows of the Law to the substance of the Gospel.</p>

    <span class="v-num">25</span><strong>and did not know her until she brought forth her son—the first-born, and he called His Name Jesus.</strong>

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. The Genesis of the New Creation</h3>
  <p>The phrase "The scroll of the genealogy" (Gr. <i>biblos geneseos</i>) is a direct echo of the Greek Septuagint’s rendering of Genesis 2:4 and 5:1. Matthew is not merely listing ancestors; he is announcing the "Genesis" of the New Creation. In a Full Preterist framework, this marks the beginning of the end for the Old Covenant world. Jesus is presented as the "Last Adam" who succeeds where the first failed. By summarizing the genealogy into three sets of fourteen, Matthew signals that the "fullness of time" has arrived. This numerical structure points to a sabbatical completion—the long week of the Old Covenant age is reaching its seventh day, leading into the eternal rest of the Kingdom established in AD 70.</p>

  <h3>2. Saving His People from Their Sins</h3>
  <p>The angelic declaration in verse 21 that Jesus would "save His people from their sins" is often misunderstood as a generic reference to individual salvation. Within the first-century context, this was a covenantal promise to Israel. The "sins" were the covenantal transgressions that had kept Israel in spiritual exile despite their physical return from Babylon. The salvation promised was the deliverance from the curse of the Law. This salvation was inaugurated at the cross and fully consummated at the Parousia in AD 70, when the Old Covenant sacrificial system was permanently removed, leaving only the perfect, finished work of Christ. The "removal" mentioned in the genealogy (Babylon) served as a type of the final removal of the "heaven and earth" of the Mosaic system.</p>

  <h3>3. Immanuel and the Indwelling Presence</h3>
  <p>The fulfillment of the "Immanuel" prophecy (Isaiah 7:14) signifies the transition from a localized presence in a stone temple to the indwelling presence of God in His people. Full Preterism recognizes that "God with us" reached its ultimate expression when the "tent of God" was placed among men (Rev 21:3). Matthew 1 sets the stage for this by showing that God entered the human experience through the Holy Spirit, bypassing the corrupted seed of the first Adam. This "New Creation" man, Jesus, became the prototype for all who are now "in Christ." The Old Covenant required a veil; the New Creation reality, established by the arrival of Immanuel, provides face-to-face fellowship that was finalized when the earthly temple fell.</p>

  <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
  <p>Because the "Genesis" of Jesus Christ is complete, you are no longer defined by your natural lineage or the failures of the "First Adam." You live in the "eighth day"—the eternal day of the New Creation. The covenant transition is over; you possess the full inheritance of "God with us" (Immanuel) without the need for mediators, shadows, or earthly temples. You are a citizen of a settled, unshakable Kingdom.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>If the "Old" has truly passed away and Christ has saved His people from the curse of the Law, are you still living with a "shadow" mentality, or are you walking in the full light of the New Creation?</p>
