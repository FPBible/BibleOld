      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        The New Jerusalem—the fully realized Bride of Christ—has descended to earth. Chapter 22 concludes the vision by showing what happens <em>inside</em> the city, and more importantly, what flows <em>out</em> of it. The curse of Eden is officially reversed. The River of Life and the Tree of Life are fully restored to humanity through the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final half of the chapter is a rapid-fire sequence of urgent warnings and absolute time-locks. Jesus repeatedly declares that these events "must happen soon" and that He is "coming quickly." John is explicitly commanded <em>not</em> to seal the book because the time is at hand—providing the ultimate, undeniable proof that Revelation was fulfilled in the first-century generation.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do Not Seal the Book (v. 10):</strong> In Daniel 8 and 12, Daniel was commanded to "seal the book" because the events prophesied were many hundreds of years away. Here, the angel explicitly reverses that command. He tells John, "Don't seal up the words... for the time is at hand." You cannot insert a 2,000-year delay between verse 10 and fulfillment without destroying the angel's clear meaning. The judgment of Jerusalem (AD 70) was imminent.</li>
        <li><strong>Outside Are the Dogs (v. 15):</strong> This verse shatters the futurist idea of a perfect, end-of-time physical utopia. If the New Jerusalem is a literal city arriving at the end of the space-time continuum, and all sinners have been thrown into the lake of fire, <em>who is standing right outside the gates?</em> The answer: The New Jerusalem is the New Covenant Church, living in the present world, shining its light into a society where sinners still desperately need the Gospel.</li>
        <li><strong>I Come Quickly (v. 12, 20):</strong> Jesus repeats this three times in this chapter. This is not a reference to a delayed, physical bodily return at the end of human history. It is the urgent, apocalyptic warning of His localized, covenantal judgment-coming upon apostate Israel.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>water of life</strong> — In John 7:37-39, Jesus explicitly defines the "rivers of living water" as the Holy Spirit, which believers would receive. This river flows from the throne, through the Church, into the world.</li>
        <li><strong>tree of life</strong> — Lost in Genesis 3 due to covenantal rebellion, it is fully restored in Revelation 22 through Christ's obedience. Believers have absolute, unrestricted access to it today.</li>
        <li><strong>dogs</strong> — A common first-century Jewish idiom for the ceremonially unclean, the uncircumcised, or the aggressively wicked (Philippians 3:2, Matthew 7:6). Here it refers to those who remain in their unbelief outside the New Covenant.</li>
        <li><strong>root and offspring of David</strong> — The ultimate fulfillment of the messianic lineage. He is the Creator of David (the Root) and the descendant of David (the Offspring).</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The River and the Tree (vv. 1–5)</h3>
      
      <p>
        John is seeing the absolute fulfillment of Ezekiel 47. In Ezekiel's vision, a trickle of water flows out of the new temple, becoming a massive, uncrossable river that flows into the dead places of the earth, bringing miraculous life and healing wherever it goes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the New Jerusalem <em>is</em> the Church (the true Temple), the Holy Spirit is the River of Life flowing out of us and into the world. Notice the specific function of the Tree of Life: <em>"The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        If this is a description of heaven after physical death, why do the nations need healing? There is no sickness in heaven. But on <em>this</em> earth, in <em>this</em> present age, the nations are broken, divided, and bleeding. The Church, firmly planted by the river of the Holy Spirit, offers the "leaves" of the Gospel to heal the racial, political, and spiritual wounds of the world. This is our present mission.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Finality of "Soon" (vv. 6–11)</h3>
      <p>
        Revelation opens in Chapter 1 by stating the events "must happen soon." It closes in Chapter 22 by repeating the exact same phrase: "must happen soon," "I come quickly," and "the time is at hand." 
      </p>
      <p>
        If "soon" and "quickly" actually mean "maybe in 3,000 years," then language has no objective meaning, and the Bible cannot be trusted to communicate clearly. Verse 11 highlights the sheer imminence of the AD 70 crisis: "He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still." The time for mass national repentance had run out. The Roman armies were practically at the gates. The die was cast. The judgment was arriving in their generation.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Who is Outside the Gates? (vv. 14–15)</h3>
      <p>
        This is the paradigm-shifting reality of the fulfilled view. Those who "wash their robes" (believe the Gospel) enter through the gates into the city. But right outside the gates are the sorcerers, murderers, and liars. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Jerusalem is not a gated community in the sky; it is the spiritual Kingdom of God actively existing on the earth right now. We are inside the city, possessing the Tree of Life. The unbelieving world is outside the city. But the gates are never shut (21:25). 
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Great Invitation (v. 17)</h3>
      <p>
        Because the gates are open, the mission of the Church is crystal clear: <em>"The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!'"</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not look down on those outside the city; we invite them in. This is the great evangelistic call of the New Creation. Anyone who is thirsty, anyone who desires life, is invited to leave the "dogs" and the "liars," walk through the open gates of the Gospel, and drink the water of life entirely for free. The covenant is open to everyone.
      </p>

      <h3>5) The Warning Against Tampering (vv. 18–21)</h3>
      <p>
        The book closes with a severe warning against adding to or taking away from "the words of the prophecy of this book." Many modern prophetic systems violate this warning directly. When we add 2,000-year gaps, insert modern European nations, or invent secret pre-tribulation raptures that John never wrote about, we are adding to the book. When we ignore the time-statements ("soon," "near," "quickly") to make the book fit our modern headlines, we are taking away from the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must let Revelation mean what it meant to the seven first-century churches in Asia Minor. It was their tribulation, their endurance, and their vindication.

      <h2>8. New Creation Reality</h2>
      <p>
        The story of the Bible does not end in a terrifying global apocalypse; it ends in a garden-city with an open gate and a river of life. The curse is broken. The Old Covenant system of death and separation is completely gone. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> You are currently living in the New Jerusalem. You have total access to the Tree of Life. You are washed, you are inside the city, and your purpose on this earth is to echo the voice of the Bride: "Come, and drink the water of life freely!"
