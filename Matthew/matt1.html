<h1>Matthew 1</h1>
<h2>The Messiah Placed Within Israel’s Covenant Story</h2>

<p class="note">
Matthew opens by anchoring Jesus firmly inside Israel’s covenant history.
This chapter is not background filler — it establishes legitimacy, transition, and arrival.

<h2>FP Paraphrase</h2>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">1</span>This is the record of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">2–6</span>From Abraham the line moved forward through Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and the fathers, until it reached David the king.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">6–11</span>From David the royal line continued through Israel’s kings, even through failure and collapse, until the Babylonian exile.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">12–16</span>After the exile the line continued, carrying hope forward, until it came to Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom Jesus—called Messiah—was born.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">17</span>So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen, from David to the exile fourteen, and from the exile to the Messiah fourteen.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">18</span>The birth of Jesus the Messiah took place this way: Mary was pledged to Joseph, and before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">19–20</span>Joseph, being righteous and unwilling to shame her, planned to release her quietly. But an angel appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear. What is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">21</span>“She will bear a son. You shall name Him Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">22–23</span>All this happened to bring to reality what the Lord had spoken: a virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call His name Immanuel — God with us.</p></div>

<div class="v"><p><span class="n">24–25</span>Joseph obeyed. He took Mary as his wife, and when the child was born, he named Him Jesus.</p></div>

<h2>Commentary</h2>

<div class="block">
<h3>1. Why Matthew begins with a genealogy</h3>
<p>
Matthew does not open with sentiment or theology, but with <strong>covenant legitimacy</strong>.
Jesus is deliberately located within Israel’s story, not outside of it.
</p>
<p>
By naming Abraham and David immediately, Matthew signals two covenant anchors:
promise and kingship. Jesus is not a religious innovator — He is the lawful heir of Israel’s covenant world.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h3>2. The exile as covenant collapse</h3>
<p>
The Babylonian exile is not a historical footnote. It represents the breaking of Israel’s world —
loss of land, throne, temple, and identity.
</p>
<p>
Matthew frames history as moving toward resolution: promise → kingdom → collapse → Messiah.
The genealogy is already telling you that Jesus arrives at the moment of covenant repair.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h3>3. “He will save His people from their sins”</h3>
<p>
This statement is covenantal, not abstract. “Sin” here is not generic moral failure;
it is Israel’s condition under condemnation, exile logic, and law-bound separation.
</p>
<p>
Matthew presents Jesus as the one who ends that condition — restoring access, forgiveness,
and covenant standing.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h3>4. Fulfillment as arrival, not postponement</h3>
<p>
Matthew’s use of “fulfilled” does not point forward to distant outcomes.
It marks <strong>realisation</strong> — God’s word coming to embodied reality in history.
</p>
<p>
“God with us” is not a future promise. It is the defining claim of the Gospel from its opening chapter.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Living This Now</h2>

<div class="block">
<p>
Matthew begins by grounding faith in what God has already done, not what believers must still wait for.
</p>
<p>
New Creation life starts from identity, not anticipation.
Jesus is not gradually becoming Lord — He arrives as Lord.
</p>
<p>
Living faithfully now means resting in legitimacy already secured, presence already given,
and salvation already accomplished.
