<h1>Matthew 7</h1>
<h2>The Two Foundations</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The Sermon on the Mount concludes with a series of binary warnings: two gates, two trees, and two houses. Jesus brings the crowd to a moment of decision. This is not a general moral lecture; it is a covenantal ultimatum. Israel stands at a crossroads. One path leads to life (the New Covenant), while the "broad" path—the popular zeal for revolution and tradition—leads directly to the destruction of the nation.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> Judge not, that ye may not be judged,
    <span class="v-num">2</span> for in what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and in what measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you.
    <span class="v-num">3</span> And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, and the beam that is in thine own eye dost not consider?
    <span class="v-num">4</span> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye, and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?
    <span class="v-num">5</span> Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
    <span class="v-num">6</span> Ye may not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, that they may not trample them with their feet, and having turned may rend you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">7</span> Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you;
    <span class="v-num">8</span> for every one who is asking doth receive, and he who is seeking doth find, and to him who is knocking it shall be opened.
    <span class="v-num">9</span> Or what man is of you, of whom, if his son may ask a loaf—a stone will he give to him?
    <span class="v-num">10</span> And if a fish he may ask—a serpent will he give to him?
    <span class="v-num">11</span> If, therefore, ye being evil, have known good gifts to give to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?
    <span class="v-num">12</span> All things, therefore, whatever ye may will that men may do to you, so also do ye to them, for this is the law and the prophets.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">13</span> Enter ye in through the strait gate, because wide is the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those entering through it;
    <span class="v-num">14</span> how strait is the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to the life, and few are those finding it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">15</span> But take heed of the false prophets, who come unto you in sheep’s clothing, and inwardly are ravening wolves.
    <span class="v-num">16</span> From their fruits ye shall know them; do men gather from thorns grapes? Or from thistles figs?
    <span class="v-num">17</span> So every good tree doth yield good fruits, but the bad tree doth yield evil fruits.
    <span class="v-num">18</span> A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits, nor a bad tree to yield good fruits.
    <span class="v-num">19</span> Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and cast to fire.
    <span class="v-num">20</span> Therefore from their fruits ye shall know them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">21</span> Not every one who is saying to me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who is doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.
    <span class="v-num">22</span> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not in thy name prophesied? And in thy name cast out demons? And in thy name done many mighty things?
    <span class="v-num">23</span> And then I will acknowledge to them, that—I never knew you, depart from me ye who are working lawlessness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">24</span> Therefore, every one who heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon the rock;
    <span class="v-num">25</span> and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock.
    <span class="v-num">26</span> And every one who is hearing these words of mine, and is not doing them, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;
    <span class="v-num">27</span> and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell, and the fall of it was great.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">28</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
    <span class="v-num">29</span> for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
  </p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>7:13 — Wide is the gate:</strong> The popular path of Jewish nationalism and Pharisaic tradition. "Many" followed this path straight into the "destruction" (Apoleia) of AD 70.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>7:15 — False prophets:</strong> Specifically the Zealots and leaders who promised God would save Jerusalem from Rome if they fought. They were "wolves" devouring the flock with false hope.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>7:22 — In that day:</strong> The Day of Judgment upon Jerusalem. These miracle-workers claimed Yahweh's name but were "workers of lawlessness" (violators of the true Covenant).</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>7:27 — It fell:</strong> The collapse of the "House" of Old Covenant Israel. The foolish man builds on the sand of the Temple system; the wise man builds on the Rock of Christ's words.</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Broad Way to Destruction</h3>
<p>
Verse 13 is often used as a generic evangelistic warning ("most people go to hell"), but its primary context is covenantal. The "Broad Way" was the road the majority of first-century Israel was walking—the road of reliance on the Temple, ethnic pride, and revolutionary violence. This path led literally and spiritually to "destruction" (the same word used for the destruction of the Temple). The "Narrow Way" was the difficult, unpopular path of following the Nazarene, which alone offered survival when the wrath fell.
</p>

<h3>2) Wolves in the Fold</h3>
<p>
Jesus warns of "false prophets" who look like sheep (Covenant members) but are wolves. This is not just about modern heretics; it refers to the leaders within Israel who were agitating for war with Rome. Josephus records that "false prophets" infested Jerusalem during the siege, telling the people to go up to the Temple roof to see "signs of deliverance," only for them to perish in the flames. They produced the "bad fruit" of rebellion and death.
</p>

<h3>3) "I Never Knew You"</h3>
<p>
This terrifying dismissal (v. 23) is directed at those who assumed their Jewish identity and charismatic works guaranteed them a spot in the Kingdom. They appeal to their resume: "We prophesied! We did miracles!" But Jesus calls them "workers of lawlessness" (Torah-breakers). In the New Covenant, intimacy ("knowing" Him) replaces religious performance. The Temple establishment did not know Him, and in the judgment of AD 70, He did not know them.
</p>

<h3>4) The Crash of the Old House</h3>
<p>
The Sermon culminates in the parable of the Two Houses. This is a prophecy of the two temples. The "House on the Sand" is the Old Covenant Temple, built on earthly shadows and human tradition. When the "flood" of Roman judgment came (Dan 9:26 calls the invasion a "flood"), that house fell, and "great was its fall." The "House on the Rock" is the Church, built on the sayings of Jesus. It withstood the storm of AD 70 and stands today as the eternal dwelling place of God.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
The storm has already passed. The "House on the Sand" (the Old Covenant system) has been washed away forever. We do not need to fear that our foundation might crack; we are built on the Rock that survived the greatest tribulation in history. We live in the house that is still standing, safe and secure in the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I trying to build a little "side-room" on the shifting sands of my own performance, or am I resting entirely in the House that Jesus has already built and secured?
