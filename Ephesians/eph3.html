<h1>Ephesians 3</h1>
<h2>The Mystery Once Hidden, Now Fully Revealed</h2>

<p class="hide-element note">

Ephesians 3 — WEB
</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Paul pauses his flow to explain <em>why</em> this New Creation reality
could not be fully seen in earlier ages
and <em>why it is now unmistakable</em>.
</p>

<p>
This chapter locks the timing:
the mystery is not awaiting fulfilment —
it has already been revealed
through Christ and proclaimed through the apostles.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>The Stewardship of a Revealed Mystery (3:1–6)</h3>

<p>
For this reason,
I, Paul,
a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles —
</p>

<p>
surely you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace
that was given to me for you,
</p>

<p>
how the mystery was made known to me by revelation,
as I have already written briefly.
</p>

<p>
By reading this,
you are able to understand my insight
into the mystery of Christ,
</p>

<p>
which was not made known to people in other generations
as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
This mystery is this:
the Gentiles are fellow heirs,
members of the same body,
and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus
through the gospel.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Mystery Proclaimed, Not Postponed (3:7–13)</h3>

<p>
I became a servant of this gospel
according to the gift of God’s grace
given to me by the working of His power.
</p>

<p>
To me — the least of all the saints —
this grace was given:
to proclaim to the Gentiles
the immeasurable riches of Christ,
</p>

<p>
and to bring to light
what had been hidden for ages —
the administration of this mystery,
which God created in Christ.
</p>

<p>
So that now,
through the assembly,
the manifold wisdom of God
is made known
to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm.
</p>

<p>
This was according to the purpose of the ages,
which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
</p>

<p>
in whom we have boldness and confident access
through faith in Him.
</p>

<p>
Therefore,
do not lose heart over my sufferings for you —
they are your glory.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Strengthened to Live What Is Already True (3:14–21)</h3>

<p>
For this reason,
I bow my knees before the Father,
</p>

<p>
from whom every family in heaven and on earth
derives its name,
</p>

<p>
that He would grant you,
according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power
through His Spirit in your inner being,
</p>

<p>
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith,
and you — rooted and grounded in love —
</p>

<p>
would have strength to comprehend,
together with all the saints,
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
</p>

<p>
and to know the love of Christ
that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled
with all the fullness of God.
</p>

<p>
Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly
than all we ask or think,
according to the power already at work within us,
</p>

<p>
to Him be glory in the assembly
and in Christ Jesus
throughout all generations,
for the age of the ages.
Amen.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The prayer is not asking God to initiate something new,
but to awaken believers
to live from what has already been given.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Mystery” means previously hidden, now revealed</h3>
<p>
A biblical mystery is not a puzzle waiting to be solved later.
It is something once concealed
that has now been disclosed.
Paul explicitly states the timing: <em>now</em>.
</p>

<h3>2) Gentile inclusion is the heart of the mystery</h3>
<p>
The mystery is not abstract spirituality.
It is the formation of one new covenant people
without Torah boundaries.
</p>

<h3>3) Rulers and authorities are informed, not awaited</h3>
<p>
The wisdom of God is being made known —
present tense —
to powers that once governed the old order.
Their authority has already been eclipsed.
</p>

<h3>4) Prayer flows from fulfillment, not lack</h3>
<p>
Paul prays for comprehension,
not completion.
Strength is needed to live out a finished reality,
not to trigger a future one.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
The mystery is no longer hidden.
</p>

<p>
Believers are not waiting to be included,
strengthened,
or filled.
</p>

<p>
They are learning to live
from a fullness
that already defines them in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
If God’s wisdom is already on display through His people,
where am I still waiting for permission to live freely?
