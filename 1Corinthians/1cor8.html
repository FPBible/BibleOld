<h1>1 Corinthians 8</h1>
<h2>Knowledge Puffs Up · Love Builds</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul addresses the question of food offered to idols.
He agrees that idols have no real existence
and that there is only one God.
But knowledge alone is not the measure of maturity.
Love is.
</p>

<p>
Some believers understand their freedom clearly.
Others, shaped by their former associations,
experience distress when acting against conscience.
Paul insists that freedom must be guided by love,
not asserted at the expense of another.
</p>

<p>
To wound a fellow believer’s conscience
is to wound Christ Himself.
Freedom that ignores love
ceases to be freedom.
</p>

<p>
Paul concludes with a personal resolve:
he would rather relinquish a legitimate freedom
than cause another to stumble.
Love governs liberty.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Corinth is navigating life in a pagan environment.
The issue is not theology but posture:
how freedom is exercised within shared life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Monotheism is assumed, not debated</h3>
<p>
Paul affirms there is one God and one Lord.
The problem is not false belief,
but relational damage caused by careless certainty.
</p>

<h3>2) Conscience is shaped, not ignored</h3>
<p>
Paul does not absolutise conscience,
but he honours its formation.
Growth never comes through coercion.
</p>

<h3>3) Love defines New Covenant maturity</h3>
<p>
Knowledge can inflate the ego.
Love builds community.
The New Creation is recognised by care,
not correctness.
</p>

<h3>4) Christ identifies with the weak</h3>
<p>
To act without regard for another
is to act without regard for Christ.
Union reshapes responsibility.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Romans 14 — conscience and freedom</li>
  <li>Galatians 5 — freedom through love</li>
  <li>Philippians 2 — self-giving mindset</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Freedom in Christ is not about asserting rights.
It is about building people.
Love does not restrict freedom;
it directs it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be using freedom
without considering how it affects others?
</p>
