  <div class="card scripture" aria-label="Isaiah 11 (WEB)">
    <p><span class="v">1</span> A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.</p>

    <p><span class="v">2</span> Yahweh’s Spirit will rest on him: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.</p>

    <p><span class="v">3</span> His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh. He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing of his ears;</p>

    <p><span class="v">4</span> but he will judge the poor with righteousness, and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="v">5</span> Righteousness will be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his waist.</p>

    <p><span class="v">6</span> The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together; and a little child will lead them.</p>

    <p><span class="v">7</span> The cow and the bear will graze. Their young ones will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the ox.</p>

    <p><span class="v">8</span> The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole, and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.</p>

    <p><span class="v">9</span> They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="v">10</span> It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.</p>

    <p><span class="v">11</span> It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="v">12</span> He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="v">13</span> The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim.</p>

    <p><span class="v">14</span> They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them.</p>

    <p><span class="v">15</span> Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals.</p>

    <p><span class="v">16</span> There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

  <h3>1) The “stock of Jesse” is old kingship cut down</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah starts with a stump. Jesse is David’s father, and “the stock of Jesse” places the promise inside the Davidic line while announcing its humiliation.
    The picture is not of a thriving dynasty expanding itself; it is of a tree cut down until only a stock remains.
    That is the point: the glory of the old kingship is brought low, and human confidence in the old order is stripped.
    The Messiah arrives as God’s answer after the cutting—life rising where Israel’s political hope looks finished.
    The Branch does not renovate the old confidence-system; he replaces it with Spirit-governed rule.
  </p>

  <h3>2) The Spirit resting on him defines the kind of kingdom this is</h3>
  <p>
    “Yahweh’s Spirit will rest on him” announces settled presence and settled authority.
    This is not a momentary empowerment; it is the defining reality of his reign.
    The Spirit listed is wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and fear of Yahweh—covenant leadership from the inside out.
    That means this kingdom does not run on propaganda, charisma, or human intimidation.
    It runs on truth, discernment, and righteousness.
    The Messiah rules as God’s faithful king—doing what Israel’s kings failed to do: judging rightly, protecting the vulnerable, and establishing justice as normal.
  </p>

  <h3>3) He judges by reality, not by appearances</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah insists that Messiah “will not judge by the sight of his eyes” or by what he merely hears.
    He sees what others miss and judges what others distort.
    The poor and the humble are not treated as disposable; they are the very ones named as recipients of righteous judgment.
    This is covenant correction: God’s king overturns the standard human pattern where power protects itself.
    Under Messiah, the weak are defended and the proud are exposed, because the reign is anchored in Yahweh’s fear, not in human advantage.
  </p>

  <h3>4) “Rod of his mouth” is kingdom advance by word</h3>
  <p>
    “He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth” locates authority in speech—decree, proclamation, verdict.
    His mouth is not metaphor for empty talk; it is the instrument of judgment because his word carries divine authority.
    Isaiah adds, “with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.”
    Wickedness is not allowed to keep defining the covenant world.
    The Messiah does not need the machinery of violence to establish his reign; he speaks truth, renders judgment, and breaks the power of corruption by the authority of his word.
    This aligns with the New Covenant reality where Christ rules by proclamation and summons the nations through gospel announcement, not by coercion.
  </p>

  <h3>5) Righteousness and faithfulness are his constant clothing</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah pictures righteousness and faithfulness as the belt around his waist.
    Belts hold everything together; they signal readiness and stability.
    This is not occasional justice when convenient; it is the Messiah’s permanent posture.
    Where old rulers shifted with fear, bribes, and alliances, Messiah is fixed.
    His faithfulness is not a mood; it is a governing principle.
    That is why peace imagery can follow—because reconciliation requires a ruler who will not be bought, bent, or manipulated.
  </p>

  <h3>6) The peace imagery announces hostility ended inside God’s holy mountain</h3>
  <p>
    The wolf with the lamb, leopard with the young goat, and a child leading them declares a new operating principle: harm is no longer the law of life inside God’s domain.
    Isaiah places the meaning: “They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain.”
    This is covenant peace—reconciled life where predation and fear no longer govern relationships.
    It is not sentimental poetry; it is a prophetic declaration that Messiah’s reign disarms hostility and creates a community where the knowledge of Yahweh produces safety.
    The child leading signals a world no longer driven by threat.
    The point is not animal trivia; the point is a new humanity formed under a new king.
  </p>

  <h3>7) “The earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh” is saturation, not scarcity</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah uses the strongest image he can reach for: “as the waters cover the sea.”
    This is fullness, permeation, saturation—knowledge of Yahweh everywhere it is meant to be.
    Knowledge here is not mere information; it is covenant knowing—God made known, God trusted, God obeyed, God loved.
    Where Yahweh is known, peace follows because the true centre is restored.
    This connects directly to New Covenant reality: God is no longer accessed through priestly gatekeeping; he is made known in Messiah, and the nations are drawn into that knowledge.
  </p>

  <h3>8) The Root of Jesse becomes the banner for the nations</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah turns outward: “the nations will seek the root of Jesse.”
    This is explicit Gentile inclusion under the Messiah.
    The banner imagery is public: Messiah stands as the rallying centre for gathered peoples.
    The kingdom is not a closed ethnic project; it is Messiah-centred humanity.
    His “resting place will be glorious” because God’s presence rests where the king reigns.
    Zion’s glory is not temple gold; it is the settled reality of God dwelling with his gathered people under the Messiah.
  </p>

  <h3>9) Remnant recovery is restoration through upheaval</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah names a remnant recovered from the nations—a people brought back from dispersion.
    This is covenant restoration language: God retrieves what was scattered and reconstitutes his people.
    The banner is raised again, and outcasts are assembled.
    Isaiah’s goal is not mere geography; it is covenant life restored.
    The chapter insists that God’s hand is doing this: “the Lord will set his hand again the second time.”
    Restoration is not achieved by human momentum; it is accomplished by divine action.
  </p>

  <h3>10) Hostility inside Israel is cut off, and barriers are crossed by God’s highway</h3>
  <p>
    Ephraim and Judah represent deep internal rivalry, yet Isaiah announces envy and persecution ended.
    That is a prototype of one reconciled people: hostility removed, jealousy disarmed, persecution cut off.
    Then Isaiah brings exodus imagery—sea, river, sandals, and a highway—declaring that God makes a way where the old world said “no way.”
    The “highway” is access: God-prepared passage through former barriers into restored covenant life.
    Isaiah 11 therefore stands as a covenant blueprint: the old kingship is cut down, Messiah rises by the Spirit, hostility is dismantled, the nations are gathered under one banner, and God makes a way for a restored people to walk in his peace.
