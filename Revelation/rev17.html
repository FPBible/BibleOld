      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        The seventh bowl of wrath in Chapter 16 fractured the Great City. Now, in Chapter 17, an angel stops the narrative to give John a detailed, "behind-the-scenes" explanation of exactly <em>who</em> this Great City is and <em>why</em> she is being judged so severely.
      </p>
      <p>
        John is taken into the wilderness to see a horrifying parody of the pure Bride of Christ: a wealthy, blood-drunk Harlot. She is riding on the back of the Roman Beast. This chapter exposes the unholy alliance between apostate Jerusalem (the Harlot) and the Roman Empire (the Beast), which successfully crucified the Messiah and persecuted the early church, before Rome ultimately turns on Jerusalem to destroy her in AD 70.

      <div class="scripture-text">
        <span class="v-num">1</span> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">3</span> He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> And on her forehead a name was written, “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> The angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.<br />
        <span class="v-num">11</span> The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.<br />
        <span class="v-num">12</span> The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.<br />
        <span class="v-num">14</span> These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">15</span> He said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.<br />
        <span class="v-num">16</span> The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, will make her desolate, will strip her naked, will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.<br />
        <span class="v-num">17</span> For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.<br />
        <span class="v-num">18</span> The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.”

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Harlot is Jerusalem:</strong> In biblical theology, a city can only be called a "harlot" or an "adulteress" if she was previously in a marital covenant with God. Pagan cities (like Rome or physical Babylon) were never married to God, so they cannot be guilty of spiritual adultery. Ezekiel 16 repeatedly calls Jerusalem a "harlot" for relying on foreign nations instead of Yahweh. The Harlot is apostate, first-century Israel.</li>
        <li><strong>The High Priest's Garments (v. 4):</strong> The woman is dressed in purple, scarlet, gold, and precious stones. These are the exact, required colors and materials of the Old Covenant High Priest's garments (Exodus 28). She represents the corrupt Levitical temple system.</li>
        <li><strong>The Beast Turns on the Harlot (v. 16):</strong> Jerusalem "rode the beast" by using Roman political power to crucify Jesus ("We have no king but Caesar!") and execute Christians. But in AD 67-70, the Roman Beast turned on her, stripped her naked, and completely burned her with fire, exactly fulfilling verse 16.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>carried me into a wilderness</strong> — A stark contrast to the Bride, who comes down from a high mountain. The Harlot dwells in spiritual barrenness.</li>
        <li><strong>name on her forehead</strong> — The High Priest wore a golden plate on his forehead that read "Holy to the Lord." The Harlot wears a blasphemous parody of that crown, identifying her true spiritual allegiance.</li>
        <li><strong>seven mountains (v. 9)</strong> — The beast the woman rides has seven heads, which the angel identifies as "seven mountains." In the ancient world, Rome was universally famous as the "City of Seven Hills." This explicitly identifies the Beast as the Roman Empire.</li>
        <li><strong>burn her utterly with fire (v. 16)</strong> — According to Leviticus 21:9, if the daughter of a priest becomes a harlot, her penalty is not stoning; she must be <em>burned with fire</em>. Apostate Jerusalem (the priestly city) played the harlot and was judged by the exact standard of the Law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Unholy Alliance (vv. 1–6)</h3>
      <p>
        The vision presents a grotesque partnership. The Harlot (Jerusalem) is riding the Beast (Rome). In the Gospels, the Jewish leadership repeatedly allied themselves with Rome to accomplish their goals. They used Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus, they relied on Pilate to execute Him, and they used Roman magistrates to hunt down Paul. 
      </p>
      <p>
        John is "amazed" when he sees her. Why? If the Harlot was simply a pagan city like Rome, there would be no reason to be amazed; pagans act like pagans. But John is looking at the holy city of Jerusalem, the bride of Yahweh, now transformed into a blood-drunk, demon-possessed prostitute murdering the true saints of God. It is a stunning, tragic realization.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Seven Kings and the "One Is" (vv. 7–11)</h3>
      <p>
        The angel explains that the seven heads of the Beast are not just seven hills (Rome), but also seven kings. He gives a precise timeline: <em>"Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come."</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This completely shatters futurism. The angel tells John that the sixth king is currently ruling ("the one is") at the time Revelation was written. If we look at the first-century Roman Imperial dynasty (starting with Julius Caesar, the first to declare himself dictator for life), the sequence is perfect:
        <ol>
          <li>Julius Caesar (Fallen)</li>
          <li>Augustus (Fallen)</li>
          <li>Tiberius (Fallen)</li>
          <li>Caligula (Fallen)</li>
          <li>Claudius (Fallen)</li>
          <li><strong>Nero (The one who IS)</strong></li>
          <li>Galba (Has not yet come, and when he comes, he must continue a short time—Galba reigned for only 7 months).</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Revelation was not written for the 21st century. It was written directly to Christians living under the terrifying reign of the sixth king: Emperor Nero.
      </p>

      <h3>3) The Beast Devours the Harlot (vv. 12–18)</h3>
      <p>
        The ten horns represent the provincial kings and auxiliary rulers allied with the Roman Empire. Initially, Jerusalem and Rome were allies against Christ. But God is absolutely sovereign over history. Verse 17 says, <em>"For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        God caused the Roman Beast to turn its hatred toward the Jewish Harlot. In AD 66, the Jewish rebellion broke out. Rome responded by marching its legions (and the auxiliary armies of the ten kings) down into Judea. They surrounded Jerusalem, starved her, slaughtered her people ("eat her flesh"), and ultimately set the great Temple on fire ("burn her utterly with fire"), fulfilling the Levitical penalty for a priestly harlot. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Verse 18 notes that she is the city that "reigns over the kings of the earth [the Land]." Jerusalem was the covenantal capital, the center of the Jewish world, dictating the religious and political life of the Land of Judea until Rome completely desolated her.

      <h2>8. New Creation Reality</h2>
      <p>
        The Harlot is gone. The corrupt religious system that dressed itself in the robes of the priesthood while murdering the true followers of Christ was completely removed in AD 70. God does not share His glory with an unfaithful system. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> Because the unfaithful Harlot was judged, the way was cleared for the true, pure, and spotless Bride of Christ—the New Jerusalem—to be unveiled in all her glory. You are part of that faithful Bride today.
