<h1>Ephesians 1</h1>
<h2>Blessed in Christ · Adopted · Seated · All Things Gathered</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Every Blessing Already Given (Eph 1:1–14)</h2>

<p><strong>1:1–2</strong> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>1:3</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.</p>

<p><strong>1:4–6</strong> He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him in love. He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace, which He freely gave us in the Beloved.</p>

<p><strong>1:7–10</strong> In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us with all wisdom and insight. He made known to us the mystery of His will — to bring everything together in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth.</p>

<p><strong>1:11–14</strong> In Him we were also claimed as an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to His will, so that we might exist for the praise of His glory. In Him you also, when you heard the word of truth — the gospel of your salvation — and believed, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance, until the redemption of God’s possession.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Knowing What Has Been Given (Eph 1:15–23)</h2>

<p><strong>1:15–17</strong> For this reason, since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, I do not stop giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.</p>

<p><strong>1:18–19</strong> I pray that the eyes of your heart would be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.</p>

<p><strong>1:20–23</strong> This power He exercised in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places — far above every ruler, authority, power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one coming. He placed all things under His feet and gave Him as head over everything to the church, which is His body — the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians opens with declaration, not instruction.
Paul is not telling believers how to get blessed —
he is telling them they already are.
</p>

<p>
This chapter establishes the foundation for everything that follows:
identity before behaviour,
belonging before walking,
seating before standing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) “Every spiritual blessing” leaves nothing pending</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say “some blessings now, more later.”
He says every blessing has been given in Christ.
This immediately dismantles performance-based spirituality.
</p>

<h3>2) Election is corporate and Christ-centred</h3>
<p>
The choosing language here is not about random individual selection.
It is about God’s decision to create a people <em>in Christ</em>.
Union comes first; participation follows.
</p>

<h3>3) Adoption replaces distance with belonging</h3>
<p>
Adoption is not a future hope.
It is a present status.
Believers are not guests waiting outside —
they belong in the household.
</p>

<h3>4) “Heavenly places” signals shared access and authority</h3>
<p>
This is not geography.
It is covenant position.
Believers share in Christ’s seated status —
access secured, hostility ended.
</p>

<h3>5) The “mystery” is not hidden anymore</h3>
<p>
The mystery is revealed: God’s plan is to gather everything together in Christ.
Division is not the future.
Unity in Christ is.
</p>

<h3>6) Christ’s reign is already established</h3>
<p>
Paul places Christ above all powers and authorities now,
not after a delay.
This reign is the basis for confidence, not speculation.
</p>

<h3>7) The church is fullness, not deficiency</h3>
<p>
The church is not described as lacking something Christ must later supply.
It is called His fullness —
the living expression of His completed work.
</p>

<h2>Key Idioms & Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Before the foundation of the world”</strong> — God’s purpose set before covenant history unfolded.</li>
  <li><strong>“Heavenly places”</strong> — realm of authority and access in Christ.</li>
  <li><strong>“Mystery”</strong> — once hidden, now revealed reality.</li>
  <li><strong>“Sealed with the Spirit”</strong> — confirmed belonging, not probation.</li>
  <li><strong>“This age / the one coming”</strong> — covenant-age language, not planetary timelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 1 removes the anxiety from faith.
You are not trying to reach a status.
You are learning to live from one already given.
</p>

<p>
Blessed.
Adopted.
Forgiven.
Included.
Seated.
</p>

<p>
The prayer is not for God to do more —
it is for eyes to see what has already been done.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still living as though blessing, belonging,
or access depends on performance —
instead of resting in what has already been given in Christ?
