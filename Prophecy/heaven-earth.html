<h1>Heaven and Earth</h1>
<h2>Covenant World Language · Not Physical Cosmology</h2>

<p>
In Scripture, “heaven and earth” is often covenant language: an ordered world of authority, worship, law, and identity.
It can describe the structure of a covenant administration—who rules, how access is defined, and how the people are governed—
not merely the material universe.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Key control:</strong>
  In prophetic contexts, “heaven and earth” frequently functions as covenant-order language
  (a world of worship and authority), especially in judgment/transition passages.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>1) “Heaven and Earth” in Covenant Lawsuit Language</h2>

<p>
The prophets regularly call “heaven and earth” as witnesses in covenant lawsuits.
This is legal-prophetic rhetoric: the covenant order is summoned to hear the indictment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/ISA01.htm">Isaiah 1 (WEB)</a> — “Hear, heavens… give ear, earth…” (covenant indictment)</li>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/DEU32.htm">Deuteronomy 32 (WEB)</a> — “Give ear, heavens… let the earth hear…” (covenant witness song)</li>
</ul>

<p>
These passages are not teaching astronomy. They are using the “heaven/earth” pair as covenant courtroom language.
That’s why the same pair can be “shaken,” “worn out,” or “passed away” when a covenant order is judged and replaced.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) What “Heaven” and “Earth” Often Map To</h2>

<p>
In prophetic-covenant usage, the pair commonly maps like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heaven</strong> — the ruling order (authority, leadership, priestly/temple administration)</li>
  <li><strong>Earth</strong> — the people living under that order (the covenant community in the land)</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
This mapping doesn’t mean the Bible never speaks about the physical heavens and earth.
It means: in prophetic judgment/transition contexts, the language often carries covenant meaning.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Creation / De-Creation Imagery in the Prophets</h2>

<p>
The prophets describe covenant collapse using “creation reversal” imagery: sun darkened, stars falling, heavens shaken, earth trembling.
This is stock prophetic vocabulary for the fall of a ruling order.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/ISA13.htm">Isaiah 13 (WEB)</a> — Babylon judgment with cosmic imagery</li>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/ISA34.htm">Isaiah 34 (WEB)</a> — Edom judgment with heavens/scroll imagery</li>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/EZK32.htm">Ezekiel 32 (WEB)</a> — Egypt judgment with cosmic signs</li>
</ul>

<p>
None of these passages report the end of the physical universe.
They use de-creation imagery to describe the end of a political/covenantal “world.”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Jesus and “Heaven and Earth” (Matthew 24:35)</h2>

<p>
Jesus stands in this prophetic tradition.
In Matthew 24, the discourse is anchored in the temple’s judgment and locked to “this generation.”
Within that covenant horizon, Jesus says:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/MAT24.htm">Matthew 24 (WEB)</a> — “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that setting, “heaven and earth” functions as covenant-order language: the old administration (temple-centred world)
is shakable and passing; Christ’s word is the fixed authority of the new order.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Context rule:</strong>
  Matthew 24 is not framed as cosmology.
  It is framed as temple judgment + covenant crisis + time-lock (“this generation”).
</div>

<hr />

<h2>5) Hebrews 12: Shaking, Removal, and the Unshakable Kingdom</h2>

<p>
Hebrews 12 explicitly interprets “shaking” language.
The point is not the destruction of creation,
but the removal of what can be shaken so that what cannot be shaken remains.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/HEB12.htm">Hebrews 12 (WEB)</a> — shaking/removal → unshakable kingdom</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hebrews is temple-and-covenant argument from start to finish:
priesthood, sacrifice, access, and covenant replacement.
So when Hebrews speaks of shaking “heaven and earth,” it is covenant transition language:
the old order removed; the kingdom received.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) 2 Peter 3: “Heavens and Earth” and Isaiah’s New Creation Promise</h2>

<p>
2 Peter 3 is often forced into “planet incineration” readings,
but Peter’s own framing points to covenant judgment and transition,
and his “new heavens and new earth” expectation comes from Isaiah’s promise.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/2PE03.htm">2 Peter 3 (WEB)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/ISA65.htm">Isaiah 65 (WEB)</a> — source of “new heavens and new earth” promise</li>
  <li><a href="https://ebible.org/web/ISA66.htm">Isaiah 66 (WEB)</a> — covenant outcome language in prophetic register</li>
</ul>

<p>
Isaiah’s “new heavens and new earth” is not written as an astrophysics lecture.
It is covenant renewal language: a new order of life, worship, and peace under God’s reign.
Peter draws on that promise to speak of the transition into the new covenant world.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Source control:</strong>
  “New heavens and new earth” is Isaiah’s prophetic covenant promise before it is ever Peter’s phrase.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>7) What This Is NOT Saying</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not “the Bible never refers to physical heavens/earth.” Context determines usage.</li>
  <li>Not “every occurrence is symbolic.” The claim is about prophetic/judgment/transition contexts.</li>
  <li>Not a word-game to dodge uncomfortable texts. It is how the prophets consistently speak.</li>
  <li>Not permission for vague spiritualising. Covenant language is concrete: law, temple, priesthood, access, authority.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>8) New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
If the old covenant world has been judged and removed, then you are not living under a fading administration.
You live in the unshakable kingdom now: stable access, settled identity, Spirit-life, and presence.
“Heaven and earth” passing is not a threat hanging over you—it’s covenant history behind you.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Practical outcome:</strong>
  No temple gatekeeping. No old-covenant condemnation jurisdiction.
  Christ’s word and priesthood define your access and your life.
</div>
