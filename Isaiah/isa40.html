  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p><span class="muted">Speaker:</span> Isaiah, announcing comfort and covenant restoration after judgment language.</p>
    <p><span class="muted">Setting:</span> Exile and despair are answered by a public declaration that warfare is accomplished and iniquity is pardoned.</p>
    <p><span class="muted">Covenant weight:</span> God’s word stands while human glory fades; the LORD comes to shepherd His flock and to expose idols as powerless.</p>
    <p><span class="muted">Why it mattered then:</span> This chapter resets hope: God is not absent, and the coming deliverance is God’s own arrival and action.</p>

  <div class="card scripture" aria-label="Isaiah 40 (WEB)">
    <p><span class="v">1</span> “Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God.</p>
    <p><span class="v">2</span> “Speak comfortably to Jerusalem, and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of the LORD’s hand double for all her sins.”</p>

    <p><span class="v">3</span> The voice of one who calls out,</p>
    <p>“Prepare the way of the LORD in the wilderness!</p>
    <p>Make a level highway in the desert for our God.</p>

    <p><span class="v">4</span> Every valley shall be exalted,</p>
    <p>and every mountain and hill shall be made low.</p>
    <p>The uneven shall be made level,</p>
    <p>and the rough places a plain.</p>

    <p><span class="v">5</span> The LORD’s glory shall be revealed,</p>
    <p>and all flesh shall see it together;</p>
    <p>for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.”</p>

    <p><span class="v">6</span> The voice of one saying, “Cry out!”</p>
    <p>One said, “What shall I cry?”</p>
    <p>“All flesh is like grass,</p>
    <p>and all its glory is like the flower of the field.</p>

    <p><span class="v">7</span> The grass withers,</p>
    <p>the flower fades,</p>
    <p>because the LORD’s breath blows on it.</p>
    <p>Surely the people are like grass.</p>

    <p><span class="v">8</span> The grass withers,</p>
    <p>the flower fades;</p>
    <p>but the word of our God stands forever.”</p>

    <p><span class="v">9</span> You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.</p>
    <p>You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength!</p>
    <p>Lift it up! Don’t be afraid!</p>
    <p>Say to the cities of Judah, “Behold, your God!”</p>

    <p><span class="v">10</span> Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a mighty one,</p>
    <p>and his arm will rule for him.</p>
    <p>Behold, his reward is with him,</p>
    <p>and his recompense before him.</p>

    <p><span class="v">11</span> He will feed his flock like a shepherd.</p>
    <p>He will gather the lambs in his arm,</p>
    <p>and carry them in his bosom.</p>
    <p>He will gently lead those who have their young.</p>

    <p><span class="v">12</span> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,</p>
    <p>and marked off the sky with his span,</p>
    <p>and calculated the dust of the earth in a measuring basket,</p>
    <p>and weighed the mountains in scales,</p>
    <p>and the hills in a balance?</p>

    <p><span class="v">13</span> Who has directed the LORD’s Spirit,</p>
    <p>or has taught him as his counselor?</p>

    <p><span class="v">14</span> Who did he take counsel with,</p>
    <p>and who instructed him,</p>
    <p>and taught him in the path of justice,</p>
    <p>and taught him knowledge,</p>
    <p>and showed him the way of understanding?</p>

    <p><span class="v">15</span> Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket,</p>
    <p>and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.</p>
    <p>Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing.</p>

    <p><span class="v">16</span> Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,</p>
    <p>nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering.</p>

    <p><span class="v">17</span> All the nations are like nothing before him.</p>
    <p>They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity.</p>

    <p><span class="v">18</span> To whom then will you liken God?</p>
    <p>Or what likeness will you compare to him?</p>

    <p><span class="v">19</span> A workman has cast an image,</p>
    <p>and the goldsmith overlays it with gold,</p>
    <p>and casts silver chains for it.</p>

    <p><span class="v">20</span> He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot.</p>
    <p>He seeks a skillful workman to set up a carved image for him that will not be moved.</p>

    <p><span class="v">21</span> Haven’t you known?</p>
    <p>Haven’t you heard?</p>
    <p>Haven’t you been told from the beginning?</p>
    <p>Haven’t you understood from the foundations of the earth?</p>

    <p><span class="v">22</span> It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,</p>
    <p>and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;</p>
    <p>who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,</p>
    <p>and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,</p>

    <p><span class="v">23</span> who brings princes to nothing,</p>
    <p>who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.</p>

    <p><span class="v">24</span> They are planted scarcely.</p>
    <p>They are sown scarcely.</p>
    <p>Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.</p>
    <p>He merely blows on them, and they wither,</p>
    <p>and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.</p>

    <p><span class="v">25</span> “To whom then will you liken me?</p>
    <p>Who is my equal?” says the Holy One.</p>

    <p><span class="v">26</span> Lift up your eyes on high,</p>
    <p>and see who has created these,</p>
    <p>who brings out their army by number.</p>
    <p>He calls them all by name.</p>
    <p>By the greatness of his might,</p>
    <p>and because he is strong in power,</p>
    <p>not one is lacking.</p>

    <p><span class="v">27</span> Why do you say, Jacob,</p>
    <p>and speak, Israel,</p>
    <p>“My way is hidden from the LORD,</p>
    <p>and the justice due me is disregarded by my God”?</p>

    <p><span class="v">28</span> Haven’t you known?</p>
    <p>Haven’t you heard?</p>
    <p>The everlasting God, the LORD,</p>
    <p>the Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn’t faint.</p>
    <p>He isn’t weary.</p>
    <p>His understanding is unsearchable.</p>

    <p><span class="v">29</span> He gives power to the weak.</p>
    <p>He increases the strength of him who has no might.</p>

    <p><span class="v">30</span> Even the youths faint and get weary,</p>
    <p>and the young men utterly fall;</p>

    <p><span class="v">31</span> but those who wait for the LORD will renew their strength.</p>
    <p>They will mount up with wings like eagles.</p>
    <p>They will run, and not be weary.</p>
    <p>They will walk, and not faint.</p>

  </div>

  <hr />

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

  <h3>1) Comfort is covenant resolution, not postponement</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah 40 opens with a double command: “Comfort, comfort my people.”
    This is not sentimental tone; it is a legal declaration that the crisis has reached its appointed end.
    The content of comfort is specific: “her warfare is accomplished,” “her iniquity is pardoned.”
    Isaiah is announcing that the conflict between God and His people—driven by covenant unfaithfulness—has a stated resolution.
    Comfort is not “one day later,” but “God has spoken the end of the matter.”
    When Isaiah says Jerusalem has received “double,” he is announcing full measure: the discipline has done its work, the sentence is completed, and the word now moves from judgment to restoration.
  </p>

  <h3>2) The wilderness voice is the public preparation for divine arrival</h3>
  <p>
    The chapter immediately turns to a herald: “Prepare the way of the LORD in the wilderness!”
    This is not municipal roadwork.
    It is the prophetic announcement that God Himself is coming, and the world must be made ready for His arrival.
    Valleys lifted and mountains lowered are kingdom images: the obstacles to God’s revealed reign are removed.
    The result is stated: “The LORD’s glory shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.”
    Isaiah’s “all flesh” is not vague; it is public—God’s action becomes visible, undeniable, and embodied in real history.
    The New Testament identifies this preparation with the forerunner who cleared the way for Messiah’s appearing.
  </p>

  <h3>3) God’s word outlasts every human structure</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah’s next movement is ruthless clarity: “All flesh is like grass.”
    Human glory looks permanent until God speaks.
    Empires, priesthoods, traditions, and reputations fade because they are creaturely—dependent, temporary, and easily withered.
    Isaiah is not despairing; he is anchoring hope.
    The promise does not stand because people are strong; it stands because “the word of our God stands forever.”
    This is the core New Creation stability: God’s spoken covenant faithfulness does not rot, wobble, or expire.
    When everything else shifts, God’s word remains the fixed centre.
  </p>

  <h3>4) “Behold your God” is gospel announcement, not panic speech</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah commands the heralds of good news to lift their voice: “Behold, your God!”
    That is not merely information; it is reorientation.
    Israel’s despair said “God is far.”
    Isaiah’s message says “Look again—God is present and acting.”
    Then Isaiah holds together two realities: “the Lord GOD will come as a mighty one,” and “He will feed his flock like a shepherd.”
    God’s might is not separated from God’s gentleness.
    His arm rules, and His arm gathers lambs.
    He comes with recompense, and He carries the weak in His bosom.
    This is covenant kingship: strength used for restoration, not for exploitation.
  </p>

  <h3>5) Creation language is sovereignty language</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah’s questions pile up: who measured waters, marked off the sky, weighed mountains, directed the LORD’s Spirit?
    The point is not a science lesson; it is authority.
    If God is the Creator, then the nations are not rivals.
    “The nations are like a drop in a bucket.”
    That does not demean people; it demolishes political idolatry.
    No nation, no ruler, and no system can carry ultimate weight.
    God’s sovereignty is the foundation for comfort: the One who speaks pardon is not fragile.
    He does not need counsel, and He does not lose control.
  </p>

  <h3>6) Idols are exposed as human-made and helpless</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah turns from the living God to the dead substitute.
    A workman casts an image; a goldsmith overlays it; silver chains are made.
    Even the poor participate—choosing wood that will not rot and hiring skill so the idol “will not be moved.”
    The irony is sharp: the god must be stabilized.
    It cannot act, speak, shepherd, pardon, or renew strength.
    Isaiah exposes idolatry as misplaced trust in what human hands can manufacture.
    When Isaiah says “Haven’t you known?” he is not scolding ignorance; he is exposing forgetfulness—Israel knows the true God, yet keeps drifting toward lifeless props.
  </p>

  <h3>7) The LORD renews strength to the weary inside the waiting</h3>
  <p>
    The chapter ends where people actually live: discouragement, fatigue, the feeling of being unseen.
    “My way is hidden from the LORD.”
    Isaiah answers with the everlasting God who “doesn’t faint” and “isn’t weary.”
    The promise is not that the weak never feel weak; it is that God gives power to the weak.
    “Those who wait for the LORD will renew their strength.”
    Waiting here is not passivity; it is loyal, aligned trust—staying oriented to God’s word when the old scenery still looks heavy.
    The imagery is concrete: wings like eagles, running without collapse, walking without fainting.
    That is New Creation endurance: strength supplied by God, not manufactured by anxiety.
