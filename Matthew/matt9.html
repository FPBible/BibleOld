      <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Matthew 9 intensifies the covenant confrontation: Jesus publicly exercises temple-level authority (forgiveness), challenges the purity system at the table, announces the “new wine” shift away from the old garment of Moses, and ends with harvest urgency—because Israel’s leadership has failed and the end-of-the-age crisis is pressing toward AD 70.

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">1</span>He entered into a boat and crossed over, and came into his own city.
          <span class="v-num">2</span>Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, cheer up! <strong>Your sins are forgiven you.</strong>”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">3</span>Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.”
          <span class="v-num">4</span>Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?
          <span class="v-num">5</span>For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk’?
          <span class="v-num">6</span>But that you may know that <strong>the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins</strong>—” (then he said to the paralytic), “Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">7</span>He arose and departed to his house.
          <span class="v-num">8</span>But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">9</span>As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, “Follow me.” He got up and followed him.
          <span class="v-num">10</span>As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
          <span class="v-num">11</span>When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
          <span class="v-num">12</span>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
          <span class="v-num">13</span>But you go and learn what this means: <strong>‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</strong>* Hosea 6:6 for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”‡ NU omits “to repentance”.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">14</span>Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”
          <span class="v-num">15</span>Jesus said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as <strong>the bridegroom</strong> is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
          <span class="v-num">16</span>No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.
          <span class="v-num">17</span>Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined.
          No, they put <strong>new wine into fresh wineskins</strong>, and both are preserved.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">18</span>While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
          <span class="v-num">19</span>Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">20</span>Behold, a woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe‡ or, tassel of his garment;
          <span class="v-num">21</span>for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
          <span class="v-num">22</span>But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">23</span>When Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder,
          <span class="v-num">24</span>he said to them, “Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
        </p>

        <p>
          They were ridiculing him.
          <span class="v-num">25</span>But when the crowd was sent out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
          <span class="v-num">26</span>The report of this went out into all that land.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">27</span>As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, <strong>son of David!</strong>”
          <span class="v-num">28</span>When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”
        </p>

        <p>
          They told him, “Yes, Lord.”
          <span class="v-num">29</span>Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it done to you.”
          <span class="v-num">30</span>Then their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.”
          <span class="v-num">31</span>But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">32</span>As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.
          <span class="v-num">33</span>When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, <strong>“Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”</strong>
          <span class="v-num">34</span>But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">35</span>Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
          <span class="v-num">36</span>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed§ TR reads “weary” instead of “harassed” and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.

      <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) Forgiveness on Earth: the Temple Claim is Being Replaced</h3>
      <p>
        Matthew opens this chapter with a confrontation that is bigger than a healing story. When Jesus tells the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven you,” He is doing what the temple system claimed to manage: covenant cleansing. That is why the scribes immediately label it blasphemy. In their world, forgiveness was not merely a private comfort; it was a priestly jurisdiction bound to altar, sacrifice, and authorized mediation. Jesus’ response is not to soften the claim, but to publicly validate it: “that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” This is covenant-transfer language. The old order said, “Come to us; we control access.” Jesus says, in effect, “Access is standing in front of you, and it is moving with Me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In a Full Preterist reading, this is part of the first-century covenant litigation that runs through Matthew: Israel’s leaders are being exposed as unfaithful stewards, and the authority of the age is being transferred to the Son and to His body. The healing is not a “proof” for modern skeptics; it is a prophetic sign inside Israel’s story that the administrator of forgiveness has arrived. This is why the crowd glorifies God “who had given such authority to men.” The point is not merely that Jesus can do miracles, but that covenant authority is being relocated from the old house into a new humanity.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Mercy at the Table: the Purity Boundary is on Trial</h3>
      <p>
        The call of Matthew and the meal that follows is Matthew’s way of showing the covenant shift in social form. Pharisaic righteousness policed identity by separation—clean/unclean, insider/outsider, acceptable/unacceptable. Jesus does the opposite: He calls a tax collector and then shares a table with “tax collectors and sinners.” That is not a minor cultural detail; it is a direct challenge to the gatekeeping mechanism of the old order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Jesus quotes Hosea: “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.” Hosea is not a random ethical slogan; it is covenant-lawsuit prophecy aimed at an unfaithful Israel. Jesus is saying the same covenant accusation is still true in His day: the leadership has substituted ritual correctness for covenant faithfulness. In the overlap period (AD 30–70), this matters because the old system is still operating, but it is already being judged as a failed steward. Jesus’ table becomes a living prophecy: the Kingdom gathers people by mercy and healing, not by pedigree and performance.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Bridegroom, New Cloth, New Wine: You Can’t Patch Moses</h3>
      <p>
        The fasting question is the doorway to one of the most important transition statements in Matthew. Jesus calls Himself the Bridegroom. In Israel’s Scriptures, Yahweh is the covenant Husband, and Israel is the covenant wife; unfaithfulness is described as adultery, and restoration is described as renewed marriage. When Jesus says the friends of the Bridegroom do not mourn while He is present, He is locating His ministry in the wedding-hour of covenant change: the promised covenant renewal is happening in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then He gives two analogies: unshrunk cloth on an old garment, and new wine in old wineskins. The meaning is blunt: the New Covenant cannot be stapled onto the Mosaic order. If you try, you get tearing and bursting. That’s not just “religion vs relationship”; it is structural. The Law/Temple/Priesthood system had a design life, and it was reaching its appointed end. The “days will come” language is not vague futurism; it points into that first-century sequence where the Bridegroom would be “taken away” (the cross, followed by vindication) and the community would endure the last-days pressure while the old world unraveled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The payoff is this: the New Creation is not an improvement of Moses; it is a replacement of the covenant container. The wine is too alive for the old skin. This is why later New Testament language can speak of the old as obsolete and fading in that generation’s timeframe. Matthew 9 plants the seed: you cannot preserve the old system by sprinkling Jesus on it.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Healings as Covenant Signs: Cleansing, Restoration, and the True Shepherd</h3>
      <p>
        The woman with the discharge of blood and the raising of the ruler’s daughter are not random miracle clips; they are covenant signs loaded with purity and life imagery. The discharge made the woman perpetually “unclean” under the purity code—cut off from normal participation. Her healing is not only bodily; it is a sign of cleansing and restoration that the old system could label but not finally resolve. The ruler’s daughter being raised is likewise a sign that life is breaking in where death ruled. Within the covenant-transition frame, these are signals that the Messiah is restoring what the old age could not heal: separation, uncleanness, and death’s claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two blind men crying “son of David” ties it back to covenant legality: the Davidic King is present and acting. The deliverances and healings culminate in the crowd’s line: “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” That’s the point. The Kingdom reality is exceeding the old categories, and the leaders respond by doubling down: “By the prince of the demons…” In Matthew’s storyline, that accusation ripens into the later, more severe judgments because it is a willful inversion of light and darkness inside the covenant lawsuit.
      </p>

      <h3>5) The Harvest: Israel is Ripe, and the Separation is Near</h3>
      <p>
        Matthew ends the chapter with compassion and urgency: the crowds are “harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.” That is an indictment of Israel’s leadership class. In prophetic terms, shepherd imagery belongs to kings, priests, and teachers who were supposed to feed the flock. Jesus’ compassion is not sentimental; it is the compassion of the true Shepherd stepping into a failed shepherding regime.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few” is not generic church-growth language. In the biblical imagination, harvest is often tied to judgment and separation—gathering wheat, burning chaff, sorting the field. Matthew is preparing you for the next movements: sending, warning, endurance, and the coming crisis that culminated in the end of the Mosaic age. In Full Preterism, the first-century resolution matters because it anchors the text in its stated timeframe: the harvest was Israel’s covenant climax, and the laborers were urgently needed in that generation as the old order moved toward its public end in AD 70.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a clean conclusion for today: we do not live waiting for the Kingdom to arrive; we live in the settled outcome of the transition. The mercy-based table, the Bridegroom presence, the new-wine container, and the harvest separation are not “maybe later” themes—they are the story of how the New Creation came to stand openly, without temple mediation, after the old house fell.

      <p>
        You are not negotiating access through a religious system; you live in direct mercy-based access in Christ, with forgiveness and belonging not gated by ritual performance.
        The “new wine” life is the Spirit-life of the New Covenant—flexible, alive, and not contained by old fear-based containers.
        And the Shepherd’s compassion is now expressed through His body: you carry healing, restoration, and practical mercy into real people and real rooms.
