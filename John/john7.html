<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldnâ€™t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br/>
Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.<br/>
His brothers therefore said to him, â€œDepart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.<br/>
For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.â€<br/>
For even his brothers didnâ€™t believe in him.<br/>
Jesus therefore said to them, â€œMy time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.<br/>
The world canâ€™t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.<br/>
You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.â€<br/>
Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.<br/>
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.<br/>
The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, â€œWhere is he?â€<br/>
There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, â€œHe is a good man.â€ Others said, â€œNot so, but he leads the multitude astray.â€<br/>
Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.<br/>
But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.<br/>
The Jews therefore marveled, saying, â€œHow does this man know letters, having never been educated?â€<br/>
Jesus therefore answered them, â€œMy teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.<br/>
If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.<br/>
He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<br/>
Didnâ€™t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?â€<br/>
The multitude answered, â€œYou have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?â€<br/>
Jesus answered them, â€œI did one work and you all marvel because of it.<br/>
Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.<br/>
If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?<br/>
Donâ€™t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.â€<br/>
Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, â€œIsnâ€™t this he whom they seek to kill?<br/>
Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?<br/>
However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.â€<br/>
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, â€œYou both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you donâ€™t know.<br/>
I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.â€<br/>
They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.<br/>
But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, â€œWhen the Christ comes, he wonâ€™t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?â€<br/>
The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.<br/>
Then Jesus said, â€œI will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.<br/>
You will seek me, and wonâ€™t find me. You canâ€™t come where I am.â€<br/>
The Jews therefore said among themselves, â€œWhere will this man go that we wonâ€™t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?<br/>
What is this word that he said, â€˜You will seek me, and wonâ€™t find me;â€™ and â€˜Where I am, you canâ€™t comeâ€™?â€<br/>
Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, â€œIf anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!<br/>
He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.â€<br/>
But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasnâ€™t yet glorified.<br/>
Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, â€œThis is truly the prophet.â€<br/>
Others said, â€œThis is the Christ.â€ But some said, â€œWhat, does the Christ come out of Galilee?<br/>
Hasnâ€™t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?â€<br/>
So a division arose in the multitude because of him.<br/>
Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.<br/>
The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you bring him?â€<br/>
The officers answered, â€œNo man ever spoke like this man!â€<br/>
The Pharisees therefore answered them, â€œYou arenâ€™t also led astray, are you?<br/>
Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?<br/>
But this multitude that doesnâ€™t know the law is cursed.â€<br/>
Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,<br/>
â€œDoes our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?â€<br/>
They answered him, â€œAre you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.â€<br/>
Everyone went to his own house,

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> First-century Jews gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> Israelâ€™s final feast anticipating God dwelling permanently with His people</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus openly identified Himself as the fulfillment of the temple, the water ritual, and the hope of divine presence â€” signaling the end of the old covenant dwelling system.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) Feast of Tabernacles as covenant climax</h3>
<p>Tabernacles commemorated Israel living with God in tents during the wilderness. It also anticipated a future day when God would permanently dwell with His people. Jesus stands in the middle of that feast and declares that fulfillment has arrived.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>The temple-centered expectation of Godâ€™s presence, ritual water ceremonies, feast-based access to divine blessing, and Law-mediated relationship with God were all reaching their conclusion.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>The Spirit would no longer be associated with sacred geography or annual rituals. God would dwell within His people, making them living temples from which life flows outward.</p>
<h3>4) Division is covenantal, not accidental</h3>
<p>The division among the people is not confusion but separation. Covenant transition always produces division between those who cling to the old order and those who embrace fulfillment.</p>
<h3>5) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The promise of living water was realized after Jesusâ€™ glorification and publicly confirmed when the Jerusalem temple system was judged and dismantled in AD 70. The dwelling of God shifted permanently from building to body.</p>
<h3>6) Time-Consciousness Marks the Transition Generation</h3>
<p>Jesus repeatedly references timing in this chapter: "My time has not yet come" (v. 6), "My time has not yet fully come" (v. 8). His brothers want Him to go public in Jerusalem, but Jesus knows the sequence: first the preparation, then the Passover sacrifice, then the resurrection, then the Spirit, then the judgment. All of it unfolds on a divinely appointed schedule within a single generation. When Jesus says His time has "not yet" come, He means it hasn't arrived in that moment â€” not that it's delayed indefinitely. The time did come, and it came soon.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>If Godâ€™s Spirit truly lives within you, where are you still expecting Him to appear somewhere else?</p>
