<h1>Romans 3</h1>
<h2>Righteousness Revealed Apart from Law</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Israel’s Advantage and God’s Faithfulness (Romans 3:1–8)</h2>

<p><strong>3:1–2</strong> Then what advantage does the Jew have, or what benefit is circumcision? Much in every way — first of all, they were entrusted with the very words of God.</p>

<p><strong>3:3–4</strong> What if some were unfaithful? Does their unfaithfulness cancel God’s faithfulness? Absolutely not. Let God be true even if every human proves false — as it is written: “So that You may be justified in Your words and prevail when You are judged.”</p>

<p><strong>3:5–8</strong> But if our unrighteousness highlights God’s righteousness, is God unjust to bring wrath? (I speak in human terms.) Absolutely not. Otherwise how could God judge the world? And why not say, as some slanderously report we claim, “Let us do evil so good may come”? Their condemnation is just.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — All Under Sin (Romans 3:9–20)</h2>

<p><strong>3:9</strong> What then? Are we better off? Not at all. We have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin.</p>

<p><strong>3:10–18</strong> As it is written: “There is no one righteous — not even one. There is no one who understands; no one seeks God. All turned aside; together they became worthless. There is no one who does good — not even one.” Their speech is destructive and deceitful; their ways bring ruin and misery; they do not know the way of peace. “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</p>

<p><strong>3:19–20</strong> Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the Law no flesh will be declared righteous in His sight, because through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Righteousness Apart from Law (Romans 3:21–31)</h2>

<p><strong>3:21–22</strong> But now, apart from the Law, the righteousness of God has been revealed — witnessed by the Law and the Prophets — the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus the Messiah for all who believe. There is no distinction,</p>

<p><strong>3:23–24</strong> for all sinned and fall short of God’s glory, and are freely declared righteous by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>3:25–26</strong> God presented Him as the mercy-seat (atoning sacrifice) through faith in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness — because in His restraint God had passed over former sins. This was to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time: that He is just and the One who justifies the person who is of the faithfulness of Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>3:27–30</strong> Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law — of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we conclude that a person is declared righteous by faith apart from works of the Law. Or is God only the God of Jews? Is He not the God of Gentiles too? Yes — of Gentiles also. God is one, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</p>

<p><strong>3:31</strong> Do we then nullify the Law through faith? Absolutely not. We establish the Law.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 3 is Paul’s turning point. He has dismantled the illusion that Gentiles are “the problem” (Romans 1),
and the illusion that Jews are automatically safe because they possess Torah (Romans 2).
Now he lands the conclusion: <strong>all</strong> are under sin, and the Law’s function is to silence boasting and expose accountability.
</p>

<p>
Then comes the hinge phrase: <strong>“But now”</strong>. A new covenant moment has arrived. Righteousness is revealed
apart from the Law, yet witnessed by the Law and the Prophets. The old system is being surpassed by the finished work of Christ.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Israel’s advantage is real — but it increases responsibility</h3>
<p>
Paul does not deny Israel’s privilege. They were entrusted with God’s oracles. That matters.
But privilege does not equal immunity. Covenant light increases covenant accountability.
That is why judgment language continues to appear: Torah was never a shield for hypocrisy.
</p>

<h3>2) God’s faithfulness is not cancelled by human failure</h3>
<p>
Some in Israel were unfaithful — but God remained faithful.
Romans is not “God quit Israel.” Romans is “God fulfilled His promises in Messiah.”
The covenant story reaches its goal in Christ, not in ethnic boasting.
</p>

<h3>3) “All under sin” means sin as a power, not just bad behaviour</h3>
<p>
Paul is not listing moral failures to shame individuals.
He is describing the human condition under condemnation — a world bent by idolatry (Romans 1)
and exposed by Law (Romans 2). “Sin” here functions as a governing power that enslaves, accuses, and kills.
That sets up Romans 6–8: liberation, release, and Spirit life.
</p>

<h3>4) The Law’s job was to stop mouths, not save souls</h3>
<p>
Paul is blunt: the Law speaks to those under it so every mouth is stopped.
Law cannot justify. It can define, expose, and condemn.
It reveals sin by naming it — and by doing so it leaves the world accountable.
If the Law could justify, Messiah would be unnecessary.
</p>

<h3>5) “But now” signals covenant transition</h3>
<p>
This is one of the most important phrases in Romans.
A new phase has arrived: righteousness is revealed apart from the Law.
That does not mean the prophets were wrong — it means the prophets were right.
The Law and the Prophets witness to this righteousness, but they are not its mechanism.
Christ is.
</p>

<h3>6) The “faithfulness of Jesus” is the foundation</h3>
<p>
Paul anchors justification in Christ’s faithful obedience — His covenant-keeping life and sacrificial death.
Your standing is not built on your ability to keep a code.
It is built on the faithfulness of the Son and received by trusting allegiance to Him.
This is why boasting is excluded: the entire system is grace.
</p>

<h3>7) “Mercy-seat” language places Jesus as the new covenant center</h3>
<p>
Paul uses temple imagery intentionally.
The mercy-seat was the place of atonement within the old system.
Paul says God set forth Jesus as the true mercy-seat — meaning the entire temple logic is being fulfilled and replaced in Him.
This is not “God wants more sacrifices.” This is “God has provided the final center.”
</p>

<h3>8) “Passed over former sins” explains timing</h3>
<p>
Paul is not saying God ignored sin forever.
He is saying God’s restraint had a purpose and a climax:
the cross publicly demonstrates God’s righteousness and establishes the basis for a new verdict.
This is why Romans sits inside a historical transition: the old age is ending and the new is being revealed openly.
</p>

<h3>9) “We establish the Law” means the Law reaches its goal</h3>
<p>
Paul does not mean Christians must return to Torah as covenant authority.
He means faith in Messiah confirms what the Law was doing all along:
exposing sin, pointing to the need for atonement, and anticipating the promised new covenant reality.
The Law is “established” by being fulfilled in Christ and no longer ruling as the covenant boundary.

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 3 destroys performance religion.
If you are still trying to prove your worth — to God, to yourself, or to others —
this chapter ends that project.
Boasting is excluded because standing is a gift.
</p>

<p>
The centre is not your consistency but Christ’s faithfulness.
You live from acceptance, not toward it.
That produces humility, peace, and real transformation without condemnation as fuel.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I still trying to build a right-standing identity by performance —
and what would shift today if I rested in the faithfulness of Jesus as my foundation?
