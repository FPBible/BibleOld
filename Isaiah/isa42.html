<h1>Isaiah</h1>

<h2>Chapter 42 — The Servant and the Light of the New Covenant</h2>

<h3>The Servant Introduced</h3>

<p>
“Behold My servant, whom I uphold,
My chosen, in whom My soul delights.
I have put My Spirit upon Him;
He will bring forth justice to the nations.
He will not cry aloud or lift up His voice,
or make it heard in the street.
A bruised reed He will not break,
and a faintly burning wick He will not quench;
He will faithfully bring forth justice.
He will not grow faint or be discouraged
until He has established justice in the land;
and the coastlands wait for His instruction.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:1–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>Light to the Nations</h3>

<p>
Thus says God, the LORD,
who created the heavens and stretched them out,
who spread out the earth and what comes from it,
who gives breath to the people on it
and spirit to those who walk in it:
“I am the LORD; I have called You in righteousness;
I will take You by the hand and keep You;
I will give You as a covenant for the people,
a light for the nations,
to open the eyes that are blind,
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
from the prison those who sit in darkness.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:5–7)</a>
</p>

<p>
“I am the LORD; that is My name;
My glory I give to no other,
nor My praise to carved idols.
Behold, the former things have come to pass,
and new things I now declare;
before they spring forth
I tell you of them.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:8–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>A New Song</h3>

<p>
Sing to the LORD a new song,
His praise from the end of the earth,
you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it,
the coastlands and their inhabitants.
Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice,
the villages that Kedar inhabits;
let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy,
let them shout from the tops of the mountains.
Let them give glory to the LORD,
and declare His praise in the coastlands.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:10–12)</a>
</p>

<h3>The LORD Acts in Judgment</h3>

<p>
The LORD goes out like a mighty man;
like a man of war He stirs up His zeal;
He cries out, He shouts aloud,
He shows Himself mighty against His foes.
“I have held My peace for a long time;
I have kept still and restrained Myself;
now I will cry out like a woman in labour;
I will gasp and pant.
I will lay waste mountains and hills,
and dry up all their vegetation;
I will turn the rivers into islands,
and dry up the pools.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:13–15)</a>
</p>

<p>
“And I will lead the blind
in a way that they do not know;
in paths that they have not known
I will guide them.
I will turn the darkness before them into light,
the rough places into level ground.
These are the things I do,
and I do not forsake them.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:16)</a>
</p>

<p>
They are turned back and utterly put to shame
who trust in carved idols,
who say to metal images,
“You are our gods.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:17)</a>
</p>

<h3>Blindness and the Need for Deliverance</h3>

<p>
Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see!
Who is blind but My servant,
or deaf as My messenger whom I send?
Who is blind as My dedicated one,
blind as the servant of the LORD?
You see many things, but do not observe;
your ears are open, but you do not hear.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:18–20)</a>
</p>

<p>
The LORD was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake,
to magnify His instruction and make it glorious.
But this is a people plundered and robbed;
they are all of them trapped in holes
and hidden in prisons;
they have become plunder with none to rescue,
spoil with none to say, “Restore!”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:21–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
Who among you will give ear to this,
will attend and listen for the time to come?
Who gave up Jacob to the plunderers,
and Israel to the robbers?
Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned,
in whose ways they would not walk,
and whose instruction they would not obey?
So He poured on him the heat of His anger
and the might of battle;
it set him on fire all around,
but he did not understand;
it burned him up,
but he did not take it to heart.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:23–25)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 42</h2>

<h3>1) The Servant is the New Covenant mediator, not merely a reformer</h3>
<p>
God does not only send a teacher.
He gives a Servant who becomes “a covenant for the people.”
That means covenant is not merely a contract — it is embodied in a person.
In New Covenant terms, this is fulfilled in Christ,
who does not simply announce reconciliation but is reconciliation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) The Servant’s gentleness is not weakness — it is kingdom power</h3>
<p>
“A bruised reed He will not break” is a declaration of how God rules.
The New Creation does not spread through crushing the weak.
It advances through restoring the damaged and tending the fragile.
This anticipates Jesus’ posture toward sinners, outcasts, and the poor.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:2–3)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Justice here means right-order under God, not vengeance</h3>
<p>
Isaiah’s justice is the restoration of right order:
truth, equity, protection for the vulnerable, and the end of predatory rule.
The Servant establishes this without street theatrics or propaganda.
This is covenant justice — God setting the world back into alignment.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:1–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) “Light to the nations” is Gentile inclusion without Torah conversion</h3>
<p>
The nations are not invited as outsiders to admire Israel.
They are drawn into the light through the Servant.
This is exactly the New Testament claim:
Gentiles become fellow heirs, one body, one access.
Isaiah sees the inclusion long before Paul explains it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Opening blind eyes and releasing prisoners is covenant liberation language</h3>
<p>
Blindness and prison are not only physical metaphors.
They describe spiritual captivity and covenant darkness:
people unable to see, trapped under accusation, fear, and false worship.
The Servant brings an exodus of the mind and heart —
a new way out of darkness into light.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:7,16)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) “Former things” ending and “new things” declared is covenant transition</h3>
<p>
God is announcing a shift in administration.
Isaiah is not describing a new hobby.
He is announcing a new order.
New Covenant readers should hear this as the end of the old system’s dominance
and the rise of a new creation reality centred on the Servant.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:9)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) The new song is the worship of a widened family</h3>
<p>
The whole earth is invited to praise — coastlands, wilderness, mountains.
This is not Israel-only worship.
It anticipates global praise rooted in the Servant’s work.
The New Creation creates a new worship vocabulary because it creates a new people.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:10–12)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) Judgment language targets false trust and covenant rebellion</h3>
<p>
When Isaiah speaks of God acting like a warrior,
the target is idolatry, oppression, and covenant deafness.
This is not random destruction.
It is decisive exposure and dismantling of what enslaves.
New Creation comfort is built on old-order collapse.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:13–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>9) “Blind servant” exposes the failure of the old covenant people to embody light</h3>
<p>
Isaiah turns the mirror on Israel:
the servant people were blind to their own vocation.
This sets up the need for the Servant who truly sees and truly obeys —
the faithful Israel condensed into one person.
In Christ, the calling is fulfilled and then shared with His body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA42.htm">(Isa 42:18–20)</a>
</p>

<p>
Isaiah 42 is New Covenant architecture:
a gentle Servant,
a covenant embodied,
light for the nations,
captivity broken,
and new worship rising across the earth.
It is not futurism.
It is the prophetic blueprint for Christ and His New Creation people.
