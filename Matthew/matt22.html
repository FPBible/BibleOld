<h1>Matthew 22</h1>
<h2>The Wedding Feast and the Lord of All Questions</h2>

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus continues His confrontation with the leaders in the Temple. 
He uses the imagery of a royal wedding to describe the transition of the Kingdom from those who rejected the invitation to those gathered from the "highways." 
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>rejection of the Son leads to the destruction of the old city, while the New Covenant is a feast where the only requirement is the "garment" provided by the King.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Parable of the Wedding Feast (22:1–14)</h3>
<p>
The Kingdom is like a King who prepared a wedding feast for his Son. 
He sent servants to call those invited, but they refused. He sent more, but they ignored the call—some even killed the messengers. 
The King was outraged; <strong>He sent His armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</strong> 
He then told His servants, "The wedding is ready, but the invited were not worthy. 
Go to the thoroughfares and invite everyone you find." 
The hall was filled with guests. But the King saw a man there without a wedding garment and asked, "Friend, how did you get in here without the garment?" 
The man was speechless. The King had him cast into the outer darkness. 
For many are called, but few are chosen.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "burning of the city" is a precise prophecy of AD 70. The "wedding garment" is the righteousness of Christ—the only way to remain in the Feast of the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Taxes and the Image of God (22:15–22)</h3>
<p>
The Pharisees tried to trap Him: "Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" 
Jesus, knowing their malice, asked for a denarius. "Whose image and inscription is this?" 
They said, "Caesar's." 
He replied, "Then <strong>render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</strong>" 
They were stunned and left Him.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> In the New Covenant, we are not defined by political rebellion, but by whose "Image" is on our hearts. We are God's "currency" in the world.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The God of the Living (22:23–33)</h3>
<p>
The Sadducees, who deny the resurrection, asked a hypothetical question about a woman with seven husbands. 
Jesus replied, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. 
In the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like messengers of God in heaven. 
But regarding the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read: 'I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob'? 
<strong>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "Resurrection" is a present reality in the Spirit. Because He is the God of the Living, those in the Finished Work never truly die.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Great Commandment (22:34–40)</h3>
<p>
A lawyer asked, "Which is the great commandment in the Law?" 
Jesus said, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. This is the first. 
The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 
<strong>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Love is the "fulfillment" of the Law. In the New Covenant, the Law is not an external code but an internal nature of Love.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>David’s Son and David’s Lord (22:41–46)</h3>
<p>
Jesus asked the Pharisees, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?" 
They said, "The Son of David." 
He asked, "Then why does David, in the Spirit, call Him 'Lord,' saying: 'The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet'? 
If David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?" 
No one could answer Him, and from that day on, no one dared to ask Him any more questions.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Jesus is proving His Divinity. He is not just a human descendant of David; He is the eternal Lord who has already taken His seat at the Father's right hand.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Historical Burn of AD 70</h3>
<p>
In the Parable of the Wedding Feast (v. 7), Jesus is not speaking metaphorically. 
The "armies" were the Roman legions, whom God used as His instrument of judgment to "burn the city" (Jerusalem) for its rejection of the Son. 
This marks the definitive end of the Old Covenant "invitation."
</p>

<h3>2) The Wedding Garment</h3>
<p>
In the ancient world, the host of a royal wedding provided the garments for the guests. 
To refuse the garment was an insult to the King. 
In the Finished Work, we don't bring our "own" righteousness (filthy rags) to the feast; 
we wear the garment of Christ's righteousness which has been freely provided.
</p>

<h3>3) Mistaking the Power of God</h3>
<p>
Jesus rebukes the Sadducees for two things: not knowing the Scriptures and not knowing the **Power of God**. 
The Finished Work is the "Power of God" that brings life out of death. 
The Sadducees were stuck in a materialist, "Old World" view that could not see the spiritual reality of the New Creation.
</p>

<h3>4) The God of the Living</h3>
<p>
By quoting the present-tense "I AM" from the burning bush regarding the patriarchs, 
Jesus reveals that the New Covenant is an **Eternal Covenant**. 
Death has been swallowed up in victory. We don't "wait" to live; we are alive in Him now.
</p>

<h3>5) The Footstool of the Finished Work</h3>
<p>
Quoting Psalm 110, Jesus establishes His current position. 
He is already seated at the right hand of the Father. 
The "Finished Work" means that the victory is secured, and we are now living in the time where His enemies are being made His footstool through the expansion of His Kingdom.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 22 reveals that we are the guests gathered from the highways. 
We are feasting at the Wedding of the Son. 
We don't live in fear of the "burning city" because we have left the old world behind. 
We wear the garment of His righteousness and live as those who are "truly alive" to the God of the living. 
All our questions have been answered in the Person of the Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to wear my "own" clothes to the King's feast, or have I rested in the garment He provided?
</p>
<p>
Do I recognize that I am God's "image-bearer," belonging entirely to Him regardless of what "Caesar" I live under?
</p>
