<h1>About This Project</h1>
<h2>The Fulfilled Bible</h2>

<p>
The Fulfilled Bible is a paraphrased and annotated presentation of Scripture
that reads each text within its original historical setting
and takes seriously the New Testament’s claim
that decisive covenant realities have already been fulfilled in Christ.
</p>

<p>
This is not a new translation,
nor an attempt to replace the biblical text.
It is a guided reading — paraphrase alongside commentary —
designed to help modern readers hear Scripture
as its first audience would have heard it,
and to recognise the New Creation life the apostles proclaim as present and active.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How This Bible Is Read</h2>

<p>
Biblical language is not flattened or modernised into abstract concepts.
Instead, Scripture is allowed to speak in its own idiom:
covenant, temple, kingdom, judgment, life, death, resurrection, and glory.
</p>

<p>
Where the New Testament speaks of fulfillment,
this project does not postpone that fulfillment indefinitely.
It treats fulfillment as something announced, accomplished, and revealed in Christ,
with historical consequences that unfolded within the apostolic horizon.
</p>

<p>
This means prophetic language is read covenantally,
not cosmologically.
“Heaven and earth,” “coming,” “day of the Lord,” and “resurrection”
are interpreted by Scripture’s own usage,
not by later philosophical or scientific assumptions.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase and Commentary</h2>

<p>
The paraphrase sections aim to be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear and readable</li>
  <li>faithful to the flow of the text</li>
  <li>free from religious jargon</li>
  <li>anchored in audience relevance</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commentary sections make the fulfilled perspective explicit,
but they are intentionally separated from the paraphrase itself.
This allows readers to distinguish between
the narrative as Scripture presents it
and the interpretive conclusions drawn from it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment and the New Creation</h2>

<p>
Throughout the New Testament,
life is described as already given,
access as already opened,
judgment as already active,
and glory as already being shared.
</p>

<p>
This project understands those statements
not as partial truths waiting for activation,
but as declarations of a completed covenant transition.
The New Creation is not a future environment to escape into;
it is a present reality revealed in Christ
and lived through union with Him.
</p>

<div class="note">
  Fulfillment is not the end of hope.
  It is the realization of what hope was pointing toward.
</div>

<h2>What This Project Is — and Is Not</h2>

<p>
This project is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reading guide, not a denomination</li>
  <li>a theological lens, not a polemic</li>
  <li>a finished work in progress, not a debate platform</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a denial of history or continuity</li>
  <li>a dismissal of Scripture’s authority</li>
  <li>an attempt to provoke controversy</li>
</ul>

<p>
It exists to clarify, not to pressure.
To illuminate, not to dominate.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>
Readers are encouraged to move slowly,
read contextually,
and allow the text itself to shape understanding.
</p>

<p>
If this perspective is unfamiliar,
begin with the Gospel of John.
Let the narrative speak.
Then explore the commentary as questions arise.
</p>

<p>
The invitation is not to master a system,
but to recognise life already present in Christ.
</p>
