<h1>Matthew 17</h1>
<h2>The Vanishing of the Old and the Supremacy of the Son</h2>

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Following Peter's confession and the "Time Stamp" of chapter 16, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up a mountain. 
This is the visual confirmation of the New Covenant's supremacy.
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>Moses and Elijah must fade away so that the "Finished Work" of the Son can be the only voice heard in the New Creation.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Transfiguration: Only Jesus Remains (17:1–8)</h3>
<p>
Six days later, Jesus took His inner circle up a high mountain. He was transformed before them—His face shone like the sun and His clothes became white as light. 
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared, talking with Him. Peter, stuck in "Old World" thinking, suggested building three tents: one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah—treating them as equals.
</p>
<p>
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them and a Voice said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased. <strong>Listen to Him!</strong>" 
The disciples fell down in terror. When they looked up, <strong>they saw no one except Jesus alone.</strong>
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The vanishing of Moses (the Law) and Elijah (the Prophets) signifies that their testimony is complete. The New Covenant has no need for separate tents; the Son is the Fulfillment of both.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Coming of Elijah (17:9–13)</h3>
<p>
As they descended, Jesus told them not to tell anyone the vision until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
The disciples asked, "Why then do the scribes say Elijah must come first?" 
Jesus replied, "Elijah indeed comes first to restore all things. But I tell you, <strong>Elijah has already come</strong>, and they didn't recognize him but did to him whatever they wished." 
Then the disciples understood He was talking about John the Baptist.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> John the Baptist fulfilled the Malachi prophecy. This removes any future requirement for a literal Elijah to reappear, as the "restoration" was finalized in the first century.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Power of Faith in the Finished Work (17:14–21)</h3>
<p>
A man begged Jesus to heal his son, whom the disciples could not cure. 
Jesus rebuked the "faithless generation" and healed the boy instantly. 
When the disciples asked why they failed, Jesus told them it was because of their little faith. 
"If you have faith as a mustard seed, nothing will be impossible for you."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Failure in the "New" often stems from trying to operate out of "Old" unbelief. Mustard seed faith is simply trusting the Authority that has already been given.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Second Announcement of the Cross (17:22–23)</h3>
<p>
Jesus told them again: "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised." 
The disciples were deeply grieved.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The grief of the disciples shows they still didn't grasp that His death was the legal victory required for their freedom.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Temple Tax and the Sons' Freedom (17:24–27)</h3>
<p>
The collectors of the temple tax asked Peter if Jesus paid the tax. 
Before Peter could speak, Jesus asked him, "From whom do kings of the earth take toll? From their sons or from strangers?" 
Peter said, "From strangers." 
Jesus replied, "Then <strong>the sons are free.</strong> However, so as not to stumble them, go catch a fish. The first fish you catch will have a coin in its mouth. Use it to pay for Me and for you."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> As "Sons" in the New Covenant, we are no longer "taxed" by the requirements of the Temple system. We are free, though we walk wisely among those still bound.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) "Listen to Him" - The Transfer of Authority</h3>
<p>
In the Old Covenant, God spoke through various prophets and the Law. 
At the Transfiguration, the Father effectively "mutes" Moses and Elijah. 
The command to "Listen to Him" is the legal inauguration of the New Covenant. 
We no longer look to Sinai for our instructions; we look to the Son.
</p>

<h3>2) Elijah has Already Come</h3>
<p>
Futurist theology often looks for a literal Elijah to return before a future "end." 
Jesus shuts this down. John the Baptist was the fulfillment. 
This confirms that the "Day of the Lord" and the "Restoration of All Things" were events tied to the first-century transition.
</p>

<h3>3) The Mustard Seed of Faith</h3>
<p>
Faith is not a "work" we do to get God to move. 
In the Finished Work, faith is the recognition that the mountain has already been moved in the Spirit. 
Even the smallest recognition of our New Creation authority is enough to displace the obstacles of the old world.
</p>

<h3>4) The Freedom of the Sons</h3>
<p>
The Temple Tax was a requirement of the Mosaic Law. 
By stating "the sons are free," Jesus is declaring that the citizens of the New Kingdom have no legal obligation to the Old Covenant's financial or ritual maintenance. 
We provide for it only out of wisdom, not out of debt.
</p>

<h3>5) Provision from the Deep</h3>
<p>
The coin in the fish's mouth is a demonstration that the King of the New Creation has total authority over all resources. 
We do not labor under the curse of "toil" to meet religious obligations; we live in the overflow of His effortless provision.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 17 shows us that we are no longer standing in the shadow of the Law or the anticipation of the Prophets. 
We are standing on the mountain with the Son alone. 
Our identity is that of "Sons" who are free from the taxes and burdens of religious systems. 
The Voice of the Father has declared that the Son is enough—we simply listen and rest in Him.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to build "three tents" by mixing the Law of Moses with the Grace of Jesus?
</p>
<p>
If I am a "son" and therefore "free," why am I still living as a "stranger" to God's provision?
</p>
