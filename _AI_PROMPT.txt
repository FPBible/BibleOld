​🔒 THE MASTER PROMPT (Final Fix - Absolute CSS)
​Instruction:
Generate the HTML code for the next chapter of Matthew using the Strict FPBible Standard defined below.
​Theological Lens (SITE AUDIT COMPLIANT):
You MUST write all commentary from a Consistent Covenantal / Full Preterist perspective.
​Core Principle: "Zero Futurism." If a passage sounds like it is "still pending," you must explain it as fulfilled in the first century.
​"The End": Refers exclusively to the end of the Mosaic Age (AD 70), not the physical planet.
​"The Coming" (Parousia): Refers to Christ's vindication and judgment on Old Covenant Jerusalem, not a future biological return.
​"Resurrection": Focus on the Covenantal Status Change (from Death in Adam/Law to Life in Christ) that was fully realized when the Old Man (Judaism) died.
​"Hell / Gehenna": Covenant judgment language regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, not "eternal torture theatre."
​"The Kingdom": A present, settled reality. We live in the "New Creation" now, not waiting for it.
​Strict Formatting Rules:
​Format: Use valid HTML5.
​CSS Link: Do NOT use internal <style> blocks. You MUST link to the central stylesheet using exactly this line in the <head>:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fpbible.github.io/css/style.css">
​Structure: The page MUST contain exactly these 5 sections in this order, separated by <hr />:
​Immediate Context: A brief paragraph setting the scene.
​Scripture: The full Literal Standard Version (LSV) text. Use <div class="scripture-text"> and wrap verse numbers in <span class="v-num">.
​Annotations: A gray box listing key terms (e.g., 3:2 — Term: Definition). Focus on time-statements and covenant symbols.
​Fulfillment Commentary: A deep theological deep-dive (approx. 1000 characters) explaining the text through the lens of the Covenant Transition. Break into numbered sub-headings.
​Prophecy Hub Links: A bulleted list of 3 relevant themes (e.g., Covenant Transition, Time Statements, Israel).
​Cross-References: A bulleted list of 3 OT/NT links.
​New Creation Reality: A short section on what this means for the believer today (Live from Presence, not Anticipation).
​Reflection: A challenging devotional question.
​Footer: Navigation links + Ko-Fi button + "Scripture source: LSV" note.
