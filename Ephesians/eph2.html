<h1>Ephesians 2</h1>
<h2>From Covenant Death to One New Humanity</h2>

<p class="hide-element note">
Original text:

</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Paul continues declaring what has already occurred through Christ.
This chapter explains the covenant transition described in Ephesians 1
by naming what has ended
and what has replaced it.
</p>

<p>
The issue is not personal morality alone,
but covenant location —
whether one lives under the old order of death
or within the New Creation world established in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>From Death to Life (2:1–7)</h3>

<p>
You were once dead in your trespasses and sins —
not biologically,
but covenantally —
</p>

<p>
walking according to the age of this world,
under the authority structures that once governed it,
living in alignment with desires shaped by that order.
</p>

<p>
All of us once lived there,
carrying out the impulses of flesh and thought,
and were by nature children shaped by judgment,
like the rest.
</p>

<p>
But God,
rich in mercy,
because of His great love,
</p>

<p>
made us alive together with Christ
even while we were dead —
by grace you have been rescued.
</p>

<p>
He raised us up with Him
and seated us together with Him
in the heavenly realm in Christ Jesus,
</p>

<p>
so that in the ages now revealed
He might display the surpassing riches of His grace
in kindness toward us in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Rescue Is Not Earned (2:8–10)</h3>

<p>
By grace you have been saved,
through faith —
and this did not originate from yourselves;
it is the gift of God.
</p>

<p>
It did not arise from works,
so no one may boast.
</p>

<p>
For we are His workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus for good works,
which God prepared beforehand
so that we would walk in them.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Saved” here refers to deliverance from covenant death
into New Creation life —
not escape from the planet
or a postponed future verdict.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Gentiles Brought Near (2:11–13)</h3>

<p>
Therefore remember
that you —
Gentiles in the flesh —
were once called “uncircumcision”
by those called “circumcision,”
performed by human hands.
</p>

<p>
At that time,
you were separated from Christ,
excluded from Israel’s commonwealth,
strangers to the covenants of promise,
without hope,
and without God in the world.
</p>

<p>
But now,
in Christ Jesus,
you who were once far away
have been brought near
by the blood of Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Dividing Wall Destroyed (2:14–18)</h3>

<p>
He Himself is our peace.
</p>

<p>
He made both groups one
and tore down the dividing wall —
the hostility —
</p>

<p>
abolishing in His flesh
the law of commandments expressed in ordinances,
</p>

<p>
so that He might create in Himself
one new humanity from the two,
making peace.
</p>

<p>
He reconciled both to God
in one body through the cross,
putting hostility to death.
</p>

<p>
He came and proclaimed peace
to those far away
and peace to those near.
</p>

<p>
Through Him,
both now have access
in one Spirit
to the Father.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>One Household, One Foundation (2:19–22)</h3>

<p>
So then,
you are no longer strangers and foreigners,
but fellow citizens with the saints
and members of God’s household,
</p>

<p>
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone.
</p>

<p>
In Him,
the whole structure is joined together
and grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
</p>

<p>
In Him,
you also are being built together
into a dwelling place for God
by the Spirit.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The “temple” is not future architecture.
It is the present covenant dwelling of God among His people.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Dead” describes covenant status</h3>
<p>
Death here is separation under the Law,
not lack of biological life.
Israel and the nations alike lived under a system
that produced condemnation.
</p>

<h3>2) The “age of this world” has ended</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks of an age that governed behaviour.
That age has been judged and displaced.
Believers now live in a different covenant world.
</p>

<h3>3) The Law was the dividing wall</h3>
<p>
The Law separated Jew from Gentile
and empowered hostility.
Its removal is not theoretical —
it is the basis of peace.
</p>

<h3>4) New humanity replaces ethnic covenant identity</h3>
<p>
God did not expand Israel.
He created something new.
The old identity markers no longer define belonging.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Believers do not work toward unity.
They live from unity.
</p>

<p>
Peace is not a goal;
it is a finished condition.
</p>

<p>
God no longer dwells in temples made by hands.
He dwells in a people
made new in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still relating to others
through old categories
that Christ has already dismantled?
</p>
