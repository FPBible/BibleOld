<h1>Ephesians 2</h1>
<h2>From Death to Life · One New Humanity · Peace Established</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Made Alive Together With Christ (Eph 2:1–10)</h2>

<p><strong>2:1–3</strong> You were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, following the ruler of the authority of the air — the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience. We all once lived among them, carrying out the desires of the flesh and the thoughts of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest.</p>

<p><strong>2:4–7</strong> But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, made us alive together with Christ — even when we were dead in trespasses. By grace you have been saved. He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming age He might display the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>2:8–10</strong> For by grace you have been saved through faith — and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift — not from works, so no one can boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Peace by the Removal of the Wall (Eph 2:11–22)</h2>

<p><strong>2:11–13</strong> Therefore remember that formerly you — Gentiles in the flesh — were called “uncircumcision” by those called “circumcision,” which is done in the flesh by hands. At that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>2:14–16</strong> For He Himself is our peace. He made both groups one and broke down the dividing wall of hostility, abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments expressed in decrees, so that He might create in Himself one new humanity in place of the two — making peace — and reconcile both to God in one body through the cross, killing the hostility in it.</p>

<p><strong>2:17–18</strong> He came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. For through Him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</p>

<p><strong>2:19–22</strong> So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone. In Him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In Him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 2 explains what salvation actually means.
It is not merely personal forgiveness.
It is rescue from an old world
and inclusion into a new one.
</p>

<p>
Paul addresses Gentile believers directly
to show that their former exclusion
has been decisively ended in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) “Dead” describes covenant condition, not biological state</h3>
<p>
Paul is not saying Gentiles were physically dead.
He is describing life outside covenant access —
alienated, powerless, and governed by a passing age.
</p>

<h3>2) “This age” is covenant-world language</h3>
<p>
The “age of this world” is not modern society in general.
It is the old covenant order,
defined by law, accusation, and separation.
That age is passing.
</p>

<h3>3) “The ruler of the authority of the air” is not a rival god</h3>
<p>
This phrase describes an operating power
working through disobedient structures.
It is influence, not sovereignty.
Christ’s exaltation already places Him far above it.
</p>

<h3>4) Grace precedes everything</h3>
<p>
Paul stacks verbs:
made alive,
raised,
seated.
All are past tense.
Salvation is something God has done,
not something believers are trying to complete.
</p>

<h3>5) “The coming age” is the New Covenant world</h3>
<p>
Paul is not pointing to a distant cosmic future.
He is describing the era now unfolding
in which God’s grace is displayed
through a reconciled people.
</p>

<h3>6) The dividing wall is covenantal, not emotional</h3>
<p>
The wall is explicitly defined as
“the law of commandments in decrees.”
This is not generic prejudice.
It is the covenant system that regulated belonging.
</p>

<h3>7) One new humanity replaces two covenant identities</h3>
<p>
Paul does not merge Jew and Gentile into a hybrid.
He creates something entirely new in Christ.
This is New Creation anthropology.
</p>

<h3>8) Temple language is redefined around people</h3>
<p>
The true dwelling of God
is no longer a stone structure.
It is a people joined together in Christ.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 2 ends separation thinking.
You are not trying to get closer.
You have been brought near.
</p>

<p>
Peace is not a feeling.
It is a fact established in Christ.
</p>

<p>
The question is no longer “Do I belong?”
It is “How do I live as someone who already does?”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where do I still think in terms of distance, exclusion,
or “almost accepted,”
instead of living from the peace already established in Christ?
</p>
