<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> John narrating Jesus’ early public signs</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> First-century Jews living inside purification systems, temple commerce, and Passover expectation</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The old covenant world is confronted at its center — purification and temple</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus signals that the old cleansing system and the old dwelling-place of God are being replaced by a better covenant reality in Himself.</p>

<div class="scripture-text">
The third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there.<br/>
Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.<br/>
When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”<br/>
Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”<br/>
His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”<br/>
Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.<br/>
Jesus said to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.<br/>
He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.” So they took it.<br/>
When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom<br/>
and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!”<br/>
This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.<br/>
After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.<br/>
The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br/>
He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.<br/>
He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables.<br/>
To those who sold the doves, he said, “Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”<br/>
His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”<br/>
The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”<br/>
Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”<br/>
The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?”<br/>
But he spoke of the temple of his body.<br/>
When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.<br/>
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.<br/>
But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone,<br/>
and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>The purification jars are the sign: Jesus transforms the old cleansing system into a New Covenant joy marker.</li>
<li>“My hour” is covenant timetable language; the signs point forward to the cross/resurrection and the transition’s climax.</li>
<li>The temple cleansing is not “general anger”—it is a prophetic act against a corrupted access system.</li>
<li>“Destroy this temple” shifts the centre of worship from stone to Son; resurrection is the decisive sign.</li>
<li>The replacement is publicly confirmed as the old house falls in AD 70; the living temple remains.</li>
<li><strong>"My Hour Has Not Yet Come" — But It Was Coming Soon:</strong> Jesus tells His mother, "My hour has not yet come" (v. 4). This is not vague divine timing spanning millennia. Jesus' "hour" was the appointed time of His death, resurrection, and glorification — all of which occurred within three years of this statement. John uses "hour" throughout his Gospel to mark covenant moments: the hour of His death (12:23, 27), the hour of His glorification (17:1), the hour of persecution (16:2, 32). Every "hour" in John's Gospel was fulfilled in the first century.</li>

<section id="commentary">
<h2>Prophecy Commentary</h2>
<h3>1) The purification jars are the point</h3>
<p>The jars are not decoration. They represent the old covenant cleansing economy—repeated washings that never perfected the conscience. Jesus does not merely supply wine; He transforms the containers of the old order into a sign that something better is arriving. New Covenant life is not “more ritual.” It is cleansing from within and joy that doesn’t depend on ceremonial status.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>The purification identity cycle (washings, ritual status, clean/unclean boundary maintenance) and the temple marketplace that mediated “access” are exposed as temporary and passing away. Jesus confronts the system at its centre: access-by-transaction is not the Father’s house.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Jesus brings the better wine—covenant joy, abundance, and internal cleansing—and He becomes the true temple where God meets His people. Union replaces ritual. Presence replaces place. Access is personal: in the Son, by the Spirit.</p>
<h3>4) “Destroy this temple” is a covenant time-bomb</h3>
<p>Jesus identifies His body as the true temple. Resurrection is the sign that the centre of worship has shifted from stone to Son. The building can keep standing for a little while, but its covenant authority is finished the moment the true Temple rises.</p>
<h3>5) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The replacement is inaugurated in Jesus’ death and resurrection and publicly confirmed in the judgment of Jerusalem and the destruction of the physical temple in AD 70. The old covenant house falls; the living temple remains.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>You are not made clean by repeated rituals, religious performance, or proximity to sacred spaces. Christ is your cleansing, and Christ is the true temple. God meets you in union, not location—and the “better wine” is not a future hope but present covenant life.</p>
