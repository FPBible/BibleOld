<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 13 — Living Within the Established Covenant</h2>

<h3>Love Is the Normal Expression of Covenant Life</h3>

<p>
Let brotherly love continue.
Do not neglect hospitality,
for through it some have welcomed messengers without knowing it.
Remember those in prison,
as though imprisoned with them,
and those who are mistreated,
since you also are in the body
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:1–3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews does not present love as an ideal to reach.
It assumes love as the normal expression
of life within the new covenant environment.
</p>

<h3>Faithfulness Shapes Ordinary Life</h3>

<p>
Marriage is to be honoured among all,
and the marriage bed kept undefiled,
for God will judge sexual immorality and adultery.
Keep your life free from the love of money,
and be content with what you have,
for He has said,
“I will never leave you nor abandon you”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/DEU31.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Deut 31:6)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:4–5)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Covenant security produces contentment.
Fear-driven grasping belongs to the old order.
</p>

<h3>Confidence Replaces Fear</h3>

<p>
So we confidently say,
“The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
What can anyone do to me?”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA118.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 118:6)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Confidence is not arrogance.
It is settled trust in God’s nearness.
</p>

<h3>Leadership Is Remembered, Not Replaced</h3>

<p>
Remember your leaders,
those who spoke the word of God to you.
Consider the outcome of their way of life,
and imitate their faith
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:7)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The constancy of Christ stabilises the community
during covenant transition and cultural pressure.
</p>

<h3>Grace Governs, Not Ritual</h3>

<p>
Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings.
It is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace,
not by foods,
which have not benefited those devoted to them
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:9)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Food laws and ritual observances
belong to the obsolete covenant system.
Grace now governs the inner life.
</p>

<h3>Outside the Camp: Covenant Break, Not Social Isolation</h3>

<p>
We have an altar
from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.
For the bodies of animals
whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest
as a sacrifice for sin
are burned outside the camp.
Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate,
in order to make the people holy through His own blood
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:10–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
“Outside the camp” is covenant language.
It signals separation from the old system,
not withdrawal from society.
</p>

<h3>We Belong to a Lasting City</h3>

<p>
Therefore let us go to Him outside the camp
and bear the reproach He endured.
For here we do not have a lasting city,
but we seek the one that is to come
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:13–14)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This “city to come” is not postponed indefinitely.
Hebrews has already identified it
as the heavenly Jerusalem already accessed (Heb 12:22).
</p>

<h3>New Covenant Worship Is Lived, Not Offered</h3>

<p>
Through Him, then,
let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God —
that is, the fruit of lips that confess His name.
Do not neglect doing good and sharing,
for God is pleased with such sacrifices
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:15–16)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sacrifice has shifted from altar to life.
Worship is lived out,
not performed.
</p>

<h3>Leadership Serves the Community’s Good</h3>

<p>
Obey your leaders and submit to them,
for they keep watch over your lives
as those who must give an account.
Let them do this with joy and not with groaning,
for that would be of no benefit to you
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:17)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Authority in the new covenant
exists to protect and nurture life,
not to control or threaten.
</p>

<h3>Prayer and Mutual Confidence</h3>

<p>
Pray for us,
for we are confident that we have a clear conscience,
desiring to act honourably in all things.
I urge you all the more to do this,
so that I may be restored to you sooner
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:18–19)</a>.
</p>

<h3>A Benediction Grounded in Completion</h3>

<p>
Now may the God of peace —
who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep
through the blood of the eternal covenant,
our Lord Jesus —
equip you with everything good
to do His will,
working in us what is pleasing in His sight,
through Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory
