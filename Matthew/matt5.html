<h1>Matthew 5</h1>
<h2>Kingdom Life in the Covenant Transition</h2>

<p class="note">
  Read the chapter in WEB (eBible): <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 5 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus has announced the Kingdom as “at hand” (Matt 4:17) and now forms a people to live as that Kingdom within the closing days of the Mosaic age.
Matthew 5 is not a generic “be nicer” speech; it’s covenant formation for a first-century audience living in a time of imminent upheaval—right before
the old covenant world would be publicly removed in AD 70. Jesus speaks with authority that fulfills the Law and brings Israel’s story to its intended goal.

<h2>Scripture</h2>
<div class="scripture-text">
  <p><span class="v-num">1</span>Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. <span class="v-num">2</span>He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">3</span>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. <span class="v-num">4</span>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. <span class="v-num">5</span>Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. <span class="v-num">6</span>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. <span class="v-num">7</span>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. <span class="v-num">8</span>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. <span class="v-num">9</span>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. <span class="v-num">10</span>Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">11</span>“Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. <span class="v-num">12</span>Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">13</span>“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. <span class="v-num">14</span>You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. <span class="v-num">15</span>Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. <span class="v-num">16</span>Even so, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">17</span>“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. <span class="v-num">18</span>For most certainly, I tell you, until <strong>heaven and earth</strong> pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. <span class="v-num">19</span>Therefore whoever shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. <span class="v-num">20</span>For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">21</span>“You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’ and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ <span class="v-num">22</span>But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ will be in danger of the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the <strong>fire of Gehenna</strong>.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">23</span>“If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, <span class="v-num">24</span>leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. <span class="v-num">25</span>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. <span class="v-num">26</span>Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">27</span>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery;’ <span class="v-num">28</span>but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. <span class="v-num">29</span>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into <strong>Gehenna</strong>. <span class="v-num">30</span>If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into <strong>Gehenna</strong>.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">31</span>“It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,’ <span class="v-num">32</span>but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">33</span>“Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, ‘You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,’ <span class="v-num">34</span>but I tell you, don’t swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; <span class="v-num">35</span>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. <span class="v-num">36</span>Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black. <span class="v-num">37</span>But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">38</span>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ <span class="v-num">39</span>But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. <span class="v-num">40</span>If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. <span class="v-num">41</span>Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. <span class="v-num">42</span>Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">43</span>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ <span class="v-num">44</span>But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, <span class="v-num">45</span>that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. <span class="v-num">46</span>For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? <span class="v-num">47</span>If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? <span class="v-num">48</span>Therefore you shall be <strong>perfect</strong>, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Sermon Is Covenant Formation During a Time-Stamped Transition</h3>
<p>
Matthew 5 is spoken into a specific historical moment: Israel’s covenant world is nearing its conclusion, and Jesus is forming a Kingdom people inside that overlap (AD 30–70). That means the sermon is not “floating in timeless space” as a new Sinai to keep the world running. It is the Messiah establishing what covenant life looks like as the old system is being confronted, exposed, and brought to its intended end.
</p>
<p>
The Beatitudes are not an entrance exam. They describe the remnant posture that fits the Kingdom: lowly in spirit, grieving what the old order produced, gentle rather than power-grabbing, hungry for righteousness (covenant rightness), merciful, pure, peace-making. These are exactly the qualities that distinguish those who will follow the Messiah through upheaval, instead of clinging to the old status systems (ancestry, temple privilege, elite approval). In other words: this is the character of people being reconstituted around Jesus as the True Israel.
</p>

<h3>2) “Salt” and “Light” Are About Identity and Witness Before AD 70</h3>
<p>
“You are the salt… you are the light…” is covenant vocation language. Israel was called to be light to the nations, but leadership had turned the covenant into a weapon: exclusion, self-justification, and control. Jesus restores the vocation by forming a people who embody God’s goodness publicly. The “city on a hill” theme matters because the old “holy city” is heading toward judgment; Jesus is preparing a new public reality—His community—whose life will testify that the Kingdom is real.
</p>
<p>
This is why “good works” here are not performative religion. They are the visible fruit of a different order: reconciliation over contempt, integrity over oaths, generosity over retaliation, love over tribal hate. That witness is not “still waiting.” It’s what the Kingdom people were called to display then, and what the New Creation continues to display now.
</p>

<h3>3) The Law’s Deadline Is Built Into Jesus’ Own Words</h3>
<p>
Matthew 5:17–20 is where many readers get trapped. Jesus does not “trash the Law.” He fulfills it. Fulfillment is not denial; it is completion. And then Jesus gives a time-bound framework: the Law remains intact “until heaven and earth pass away… until all things are accomplished.” If “heaven and earth” is treated as the physical universe, the Law becomes permanently binding and the New Covenant is reduced to a vague spiritual layer on top of Sinai. But Scripture repeatedly uses “heaven and earth” as covenantal creation-witness language applied to Israel’s order (the “world” of the Mosaic administration).
</p>
<p>
So the point is straightforward: the Law stands until the Mosaic covenant world reaches its appointed finish line. That finish line is not the end of the planet; it is the end of the age—publicly manifested in the removal of the temple system in AD 70. Once the covenant “heaven and earth” passed, the Law no longer functioned as binding administration. A fulfilled covenant is not still administered as if unfinished.
</p>

<h3>4) “Righteousness Exceeding the Pharisees” Is Not Legalistic Overachievement</h3>
<p>
Jesus says the Kingdom requires righteousness exceeding that of scribes and Pharisees. If we hear that as “try harder and out-perform religious professionals,” we have missed the entire covenant shift. Pharisaic righteousness is often covenant status managed by external markers—visible compliance, public reputation, boundary policing. Jesus is moving righteousness to its true covenant intent: a heart aligned to God, expressed in reconciled relationships and truthfulness. The Kingdom is not a stricter scoreboard; it’s a different kind of life.
</p>
<p>
This also explains why Jesus speaks into temple life (“gift at the altar”). He is addressing people still inside the old administration, calling them to live in a way that anticipates what is coming: a covenant defined by internal reality and relational integrity, not by temple rituals as a substitute for love.
</p>

<h3>5) Gehenna as Covenant Warning: Real Judgment, Real Horizon</h3>
<p>
The Gehenna warnings in Matthew 5 are often weaponized into generic afterlife threats. But in context, Gehenna functions as a first-century covenant warning tied to Jerusalem’s looming crisis. Jesus repeatedly warns His generation about judgment and catastrophic consequences for rejecting the Kingdom. Here, the warnings attach to community-destroying sins: contempt, lust-driven betrayal, and refusal to cut off what corrupts.
</p>
<p>
This is not soft language. It is Jesus calling His people to escape the doomed trajectory of that covenant system. If they keep feeding hatred, retaliation, and hypocrisy, they are aligning with the destruction coming upon that generation. The Kingdom way—reconciliation, integrity, mercy, enemy-love—is how the New Creation community survives the collapse and shines as “light” when the old world burns out.
</p>

<h3>6) “Perfect” Means Mature Love: The New Covenant Completion</h3>
<p>
The chapter ends with “be perfect.” In covenant terms, this is completeness—love brought to full maturity. The contrast in the immediate context is not “flawless morality” but Father-like love: sun and rain given without tribal conditions. The Law could restrain outward behavior and enforce boundaries; it could not produce that kind of whole-hearted love as the defining covenant ethic. Jesus is describing the mature life of the Kingdom—a life that reflects the Father because it is birthed from union, not from fear.
</p>
<p>
So Matthew 5 does not leave us with “try harder under law.” It leaves us with a fulfilled-covenant outcome: the Law reached completion in Christ, the old covenant world passed, and the New Creation stands. What remains is not “jot-and-tittle anxiety,” but Spirit-formed life: integrity, mercy, peacemaking, reconciliation, and love that proves the Kingdom is here.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You live after the covenant transition. The Law is not hovering over you as a threat, and AD 70 is not a future fear. Kingdom life is not “earning” sonship; it is expressing sonship.
Matthew 5 describes what Spirit-formed humanity looks like: clean-hearted, truthful, reconciling, unrevengeful, and Father-shaped in love.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I still living from old-contract thinking—measuring myself by a law-system—rather than living from New Creation wholeness that makes reconciliation, integrity, and love the natural fruit?
