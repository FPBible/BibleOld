<h1>Isaiah</h1>
<h2>Chapter 61 — Jubilee and the Spirit-Anointed Messiah</h2>

<h3>The Proclamation</h3>

<p>
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me,
because the LORD has anointed Me
to bring good news to the poor.
He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
and freedom to the bound,
to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favour.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>Restoration</h3>

<p>
To comfort all who mourn,
to grant to those who mourn in Zion —
to give a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
the oil of joy instead of mourning,
the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit —
that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:2–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
They shall rebuild the ancient ruins;
they shall raise up former devastations;
they shall repair ruined cities,
the devastations of many generations.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:4)</a>
</p>

<h3>A New Identity</h3>

<p>
You shall be called priests of the LORD;
they shall speak of you as ministers of our God.
Instead of your shame there shall be double honour;
instead of dishonour they shall rejoice.
Everlasting joy shall be theirs.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:6–7)</a>
</p>

<h3>An Everlasting Covenant</h3>

<p>
For I the LORD love justice;
I hate robbery and wrongdoing.
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
Their offspring shall be known among the nations,
and all who see them shall acknowledge
that they are a people the LORD has blessed.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:8–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>Clothed in Righteousness</h3>

<p>
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;
my soul shall exult in my God,
for He has clothed me with garments of salvation;
He has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest,
and as a bride adorns herself with jewels.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:10)</a>
</p>

<p>
For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
to spring up before all the nations.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA61.htm">(Isa 61:11)</a>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 61</h2>

<p>
Isaiah 61 is explicitly **fulfilled** in the ministry of Jesus
(Luke 4:18–21).  
This is not future hope — it is present reality.
</p>

<p>
Jubilee here is not land reform.
It is **release from covenant debt, shame, and exile**.
Captivity is broken.
Identity is restored.
Righteousness is worn, not earned.
</p>

<p>
The “everlasting covenant” is not renewed law,
but restored relationship.
The people become priests —
not mediators of fear,
but carriers of blessing.
</p>

<p>
This chapter defines the **operating environment of the New Creation**:
freedom, joy, restoration, identity, and praise
spreading outward to the nations.
