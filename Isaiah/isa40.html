      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Isaiah chapters 1 through 39 are heavily dominated by warnings of impending judgment, warfare, and the eventual Babylonian exile. But beginning in chapter 40, the tone radically shifts. Isaiah speaks across the centuries to the broken, exiled remnant of Israel, announcing that the long night of covenant discipline is over. God issues a legal decree of "comfort," declaring that the warfare is accomplished and the iniquity is pardoned. To prove this, God announces that He is personally coming back to Zion to shepherd His people. A herald is dispatched into the wilderness to prepare the highway for the King's arrival. This chapter is the magnificent prologue to the New Testament, laying the exact foundation for the ministry of John the Baptist.

        <span class="v-num">1</span> “Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God.<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> “Speak comfortably to Jerusalem, and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Yahweh’s hand double for all her sins.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">3</span> The voice of one who calls out, “Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness! Make a level highway in the desert for our God.<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain.<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> Yahweh’s glory shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> The voice of one saying, “Cry out!” One said, “What shall I cry?” “All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field.<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> The grass withers, the flower fades, because Yahweh’s breath blows on it. Surely the people are like grass.<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God stands forever.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength! Lift it up! Don’t be afraid! Say to the cities of Judah, “Behold, your God!”<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.<br />
        <span class="v-num">11</span> He will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom. He will gently lead those who have their young.<br />
        <span class="v-num">12</span> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and marked off the sky with his span, and calculated the dust of the earth in a measuring basket, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> Who has directed Yahweh’s Spirit, or has taught him as his counselor?<br />
        <span class="v-num">14</span> Who did he take counsel with, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?<br />
        <span class="v-num">15</span> Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance. Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing.<br />
        <span class="v-num">16</span> Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering.<br />
        <span class="v-num">17</span> All the nations are like nothing before him. They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity.<br />
        <span class="v-num">18</span> To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare to him?<br />
        <span class="v-num">19</span> A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts silver chains for it.<br />
        <span class="v-num">20</span> He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks a skillful workman to set up a carved image for him that will not be moved.<br />
        <span class="v-num">21</span> Haven’t you known? Haven’t you heard? Haven’t you been told from the beginning? Haven’t you understood from the foundations of the earth?<br />

        <span class="v-num">23</span> who brings princes to nothing, who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.<br />
        <span class="v-num">24</span> They are planted scarcely. They are sown scarcely. Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground. He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.<br />
        <span class="v-num">25</span> “To whom then will you liken me? Who is my equal?” says the Holy One.<br />
        <span class="v-num">26</span> Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their army by number. He calls them all by name. By the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power, not one is lacking.<br />
        <span class="v-num">27</span> Why do you say, Jacob, and speak, Israel, “My way is hidden from Yahweh, and the justice due me is disregarded by my God”?<br />
        <span class="v-num">28</span> Haven’t you known? Haven’t you heard? The everlasting God, Yahweh, the Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn’t faint. He isn’t weary. His understanding is unsearchable.<br />
        <span class="v-num">29</span> He gives power to the weak. He increases the strength of him who has no might.<br />
        <span class="v-num">30</span> Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall;<br />
        <span class="v-num">31</span> but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run, and not be weary. They will walk, and not faint.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warfare Accomplished:</strong> Comfort is declared not as a vague emotional sentiment, but as a legal decree that the Old Covenant sentence of exile and separation is finished.</li>
        <li><strong>The Voice in the Wilderness:</strong> Historically fulfilled by John the Baptist (Mark 1:3), who acted as the prophetic herald clearing the path for the King.</li>
        <li><strong>The Fading Grass:</strong> The Apostle Peter quotes verses 6-8 (1 Peter 1:24) to prove that the fleshly, genealogical glory of the Old Covenant system was fading, while the "Word" of the Gospel established the eternal New Covenant.</li>
        <li><strong>The Shepherd King:</strong> Jesus fulfills verse 11 directly, declaring Himself the "Good Shepherd" (John 10) who gathers the true remnant into His arms.</li>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>comfort my people</strong> — A sudden, shocking shift in tone. After 39 chapters of litigation and wrath, God announces the resolution of the covenant crisis.</li>
        <li><strong>double for all her sins</strong> — The discipline has done its work. The scales of justice are balanced, and pardon is freely granted.</li>
        <li><strong>level highway in the desert</strong> — In the ancient world, before a king visited a region, a herald would be sent ahead to literally clear rocks and fill potholes on the royal road. It is the language of a sovereign's arrival.</li>
        <li><strong>drop in a bucket</strong> — God's absolute sovereignty over the Gentile empires. They possess no true power to derail His redemptive plan.</li>
        <li><strong>wings like eagles</strong> — The supernatural, Spirit-empowered endurance granted to the faithful remnant who waited for the Messiah's arrival, despite the crushing weight of the old system.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) Comfort as Covenant Resolution, Not Emotion (vv. 1–2)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah 40 opens with a double command: “Comfort, comfort my people.” This is not a sentimental pat on the back. It is a legal, courtroom declaration that the crisis has reached its appointed end. The content of this comfort is specific: “her warfare is accomplished,” and “her iniquity is pardoned.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah is announcing that the conflict between God and His people—driven by centuries of covenant unfaithfulness—has a stated resolution. Comfort is not a promise of “one day later,” but a declaration that “God has spoken the end of the matter.” When Isaiah says Jerusalem has received “double,” he is announcing full measure: the discipline of exile has done its work, the sentence is completed, and the word now shifts from judgment to the arrival of grace.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The Wilderness Voice: Preparing the Arrival (vv. 3–5)</h3>
      
      <p>
        The chapter immediately turns to a herald: “Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness!” This is not municipal roadwork. It is the prophetic announcement that God Himself is coming, and the world must be made ready for His arrival. Valleys lifted and mountains lowered are kingdom images: the proud, towering obstacles to God’s revealed reign are removed, and the lowly are exalted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not have to guess who this voice was. All four Gospel writers explicitly identify John the Baptist as the fulfillment of Isaiah 40:3 (Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:4, John 1:23). John's baptism of repentance in the Jordan River was the spiritual "bulldozer" leveling the hearts of the people, preparing them to receive the incarnate God.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Flesh Fades, the Word Stands (vv. 6–8)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah’s next movement is ruthless clarity: “All flesh is like grass.” Human glory looks permanent until God speaks. The Apostle Peter quotes these exact verses in 1 Peter 1:24-25. Peter was writing to a first-century church watching the massive, intimidating structure of the Herodian Temple and the Levitical priesthood operating in Jerusalem. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter tells them not to be intimidated by the "fleshly" glory of the Old Covenant system. It is just grass. It is going to wither and fade under the breath of God's impending judgment (AD 70). The promise does not stand because human institutions are strong; it stands because “the word of our God stands forever.” The Gospel is the imperishable seed that creates the New Covenant reality. When everything else shifts, God’s word remains the fixed centre.
      </p>

      <h3>4) “Behold Your God” is Gospel Announcement (vv. 9–11)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah commands the heralds to lift their voice: “Behold, your God!” Israel’s despair in exile said, “God is far away.” Isaiah’s message says, “Look again—God is present and acting.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah then holds together two stunning realities: “the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one,” and “He will feed his flock like a shepherd.” God’s might is not separated from God’s gentleness. His arm rules the nations, yet His arm gathers lambs. He comes with recompense for His enemies, but He carries the weak in His bosom. Jesus Christ fulfills this perfectly. He is the Divine Warrior who judges the apostate system (Revelation 19), yet He is the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:11).
      </p>

      <h3>5) Creation Language is Sovereignty Language (vv. 12–17)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah’s questions pile up: who measured the oceans, marked off the sky, weighed mountains, or directed the LORD’s Spirit? The point is not a science lesson; it is about supreme authority. If God is the Creator, then the terrifying Gentile empires of the ancient world (Babylon, Rome) are not true rivals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        “The nations are like a drop in a bucket.” This demolishes political idolatry. No nation, no ruler, and no human system can carry ultimate weight. God’s sovereignty is the foundation for the "comfort" declared in verse 1. The One who speaks pardon is not fragile. He does not need counsel, and He does not lose control of human history.
      </p>

      <h3>6) Idols Exposed as Helpless Substitutes (vv. 18–20)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah turns from the living God to the dead substitute. A workman casts an image, and a goldsmith overlays it. Even the poor participate, choosing rot-resistant wood and hiring a carpenter so the idol “will not be moved.” The irony is sharp and mocking: the god must be stabilized so it doesn't fall over. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It cannot act, speak, shepherd, pardon, or renew strength. Isaiah exposes idolatry as misplaced trust in what human hands can manufacture. "Haven’t you known?" (v. 21) is not scolding ignorance; it is exposing forgetfulness. Israel knew the true God, yet kept drifting toward lifeless props.
      </p>

      <h3>7) Renewing Strength in the Waiting (vv. 27–31)</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter ends exactly where people live: in discouragement, fatigue, and the feeling of being unseen. “My way is hidden from Yahweh” (v. 27). Isaiah answers with the everlasting God who “doesn’t faint” and “isn’t weary.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        The promise is not that the weak will never feel weak; it is that God <em>gives power</em> to the weak. “Those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength” (v. 31). Waiting here is not passive loafing; it is loyal, aligned trust. It is staying oriented to God’s word when the surrounding scenery still looks heavy. The imagery is concrete: mounting up with wings like eagles, running without collapse. This is New Creation endurance: strength supplied by God, not manufactured by human anxiety.
