<h1>Romans 4</h1>
<h2>Abraham — Faith Before Law</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Abraham Declared Righteous by Faith (Romans 4:1–12)</h2>

<p><strong>4:1–3</strong> What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? If Abraham was declared righteous by works, he would have something to boast about — but not before God. For what does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</p>

<p><strong>4:4–5</strong> To the one who works, wages are not counted as a gift but as an obligation. But to the one who does not rely on works, but trusts God who declares the ungodly righteous, their faith is credited as righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>4:6–8</strong> David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”</p>

<p><strong>4:9–12</strong> Is this blessing only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? Abraham’s faith was credited as righteousness before he was circumcised. Circumcision was a sign and seal of the righteousness he already had by faith. He is the father of all who believe — both the uncircumcised who believe, and the circumcised who follow in the footsteps of his faith.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Promise, Not Law (Romans 4:13–17)</h2>

<p><strong>4:13–15</strong> The promise to Abraham and his offspring — that he would inherit the world — did not come through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. For if those who rely on the Law are heirs, faith is emptied and the promise is nullified. The Law produces wrath, because where there is no law, there is no transgression.</p>

<p><strong>4:16–17</strong> For this reason, the promise depends on faith, so that it may be by grace and guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring — not only to those of the Law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He believed in God, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that do not exist.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Faith in the God Who Gives Life (Romans 4:18–25)</h2>

<p><strong>4:18–21</strong> Against hope, Abraham believed in hope, so that he might become the father of many nations. Without weakening in faith, he considered his own body as good as dead — and Sarah’s womb likewise — yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding God’s promise, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised.</p>

<p><strong>4:22–25</strong> That is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” These words were not written for him alone, but also for us — to whom righteousness will be credited: to those who believe in the One who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was handed over because of our trespasses and raised because of our justification.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 4 answers the question Paul has been building toward:
If righteousness is apart from the Law, is this a new idea?
Paul’s answer is decisive — no.
Abraham himself was declared righteous before circumcision, before Sinai, and before Torah.
</p>

<p>
This chapter dismantles ethnic and legal exclusivity at its root.
Abraham is not the father of Torah-keepers first.
He is the father of believers.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Abraham destroys boasting at the foundation</h3>
<p>
Paul goes back before Moses to silence boasting permanently.
If Abraham could boast, the covenant would rest on human achievement.
Instead, righteousness is credited — a gift, not a wage.
</p>

<h3>2) “Credits righteousness” means status, not moral perfection</h3>
<p>
Paul is not saying Abraham became morally flawless.
He is saying Abraham was given covenant right-standing.
This is relational and legal language, not performance language.
</p>

<h3>3) Circumcision is a sign, not the source</h3>
<p>
Circumcision follows faith — it does not produce it.
Paul’s logic is airtight: the sign cannot be the cause of what it signifies.
This permanently unhooks covenant belonging from physical boundary markers.
</p>

<h3>4) The promise precedes and outlives the Law</h3>
<p>
The Law comes later and serves a different purpose.
If inheritance depended on Law, promise would collapse into obligation.
Grace would disappear.
This is why the promise must rest on faith — so it remains a gift.
</p>

<h3>5) “Law produces wrath” is covenant logic</h3>
<p>
Paul is not attacking the Law as evil.
He is explaining its function: Law names transgression and exposes covenant failure.
Wrath follows not because God is unstable, but because covenant violation has consequences.
</p>

<h3>6) Resurrection faith anchors New Creation identity</h3>
<p>
Abraham trusted the God who brings life from death.
Paul now anchors that trust explicitly in the resurrection of Jesus.
The same God who fulfilled His promise to Abraham has acted decisively in Christ.
That resurrection is the beginning of the New Creation world.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 4 ends religious comparison.
You are not accepted because you perform well,
belong to the right group,
or carry the right markers.
You are accepted because God keeps His promise.
</p>

<p>
The same faith that trusted God for life from a dead body
now trusts God for life from a crucified Messiah.
That is New Creation faith: resting in what God has done,
not striving to secure what He has already given.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be treating obedience, knowledge, or identity markers
as the basis of my standing —
and what would change if I trusted God’s promise instead?
</p>
