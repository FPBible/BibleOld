      <p>
        This page exists to settle a question that controls how the entire Bible is read: <strong>Are believers in Christ still under the jurisdiction of the Mosaic Law?</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The biblical answer is direct and non-negotiable: <strong>No.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Not under law" does not mean "less serious faith," "lower standards," or "moral chaos." It means a change of covenant world, a change of legal authority, and a change of operating power in the people of God.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> The Mosaic Law was a temporary covenant administration given to Israel. It was tied to temple, priesthood, sacrifice, land, and national identity. It was never presented as an eternal moral constitution for the nations or the church.

      <h2>What “Not Under Law” Actually Means</h2>

      <h3>1) Jurisdiction Has Changed (Legal Authority)</h3>
      <p>
        Paul’s statement “you are not under law but under grace” (Romans 6:14) is not a bumper sticker slogan. It is strict covenant-legal language. A law has authority only within its covenant domain. When that covenant ends, its authority ends with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul proves this with courtroom logic in Romans 7:1-6. Law has dominion only while the covenant subject lives. Through union with Christ’s death, believers have become “dead to the law” in order to belong to Another. If you are “dead to the law,” you are not partially under it, not spiritually under it, and not under a “moral slice” of it. You are outside its covenant courtroom entirely.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Condemnation Has Ended (Prosecution Power)</h3>
      <p>
        The Law’s unique covenant power was not transformation. It was prosecution. Paul calls it “the ministry of death” and “the ministry of condemnation” (2 Corinthians 3:7–9). 
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why “death” in Paul is not merely biological—it is covenantal: separation, accusation, exclusion, and condemnation. In Christ, the prosecuting verdict is canceled: “no condemnation” (Romans 8:1).
      </p>

      <h3>3) Identity Has Changed (People Definition)</h3>
      <p>
        Under Sinai, identity was maintained by boundary markers (circumcision, food laws, calendar observance, temple access). In Christ, identity is defined by union and new humanity. The dividing wall is removed and Jew/Gentile are made one (Ephesians 2:11–22). This is why Paul treats Law-return as rebuilding what Christ destroyed. It is regression, not depth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Walking by the Spirit Is Walking in Love</h2>
      <p>
        Paul’s contrast between <strong>Law</strong> and <strong>Spirit</strong> is not obedience vs. disobedience. It is external covenant enforcement vs. internal covenant life. The New Covenant does not produce holiness by threatening the flesh; it produces holiness by sharing life.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Walk by the Spirit” is not vague, mystical spirituality. Paul defines it clearly: the fruit of the Spirit is love (Galatians 5:22). This is why Paul says, “He who loves another has fulfilled the Law” (Romans 13:8), and “all the Law is fulfilled in one word: you shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Galatians 5:14).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Love does not <em>revive</em> Sinai. Love <em>fulfills</em> Sinai. Fulfillment means the Law’s intended outcome is reached, and its jurisdiction is no longer needed. The Spirit produces what the Law demanded but could never generate.
      </blockquote>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>The AD 30–70 Overlap Period</h2>
      <p>
        The cross legally disarmed the Law (Colossians 2:14), but the old covenant world still stood institutionally for forty years. From AD 30 to AD 70, two covenant realities overlapped: the New Covenant was inaugurated, while the Old Covenant still existed publicly through temple administration in Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why apostolic writings sound like a war zone. The letters contain sharp warnings about “returning,” “being bewitched,” and “falling from grace.” The Apostles were not writing into a peaceful theological debate. They were writing inside a live covenant collision where Torah-identity still claimed authority and demanded submission.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>AD 70: The Total End of the Law System</h2>
      
      <p>
        AD 70 was the historical termination of the Mosaic covenant world’s public center. Jerusalem fell, the Temple was destroyed, sacrifice ceased, the Levitical priesthood ended, genealogical authority collapsed, and the covenant enforcement system lost its operating infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not symbolic language. It is the real-world annihilation of the Law system as an administration. You cannot “go back” to what was dismantled. You can only reenact it as a religious imitation. Hebrews describes the old covenant as obsolete and “ready to vanish away” (Hebrews 8:13), perfectly matching Jesus’ time-statements regarding that generation (Matthew 24:34).

      <h2>Where Covenant Theology and Theonomy Go Wrong</h2>
      
      <h3>1) They Redefine Fulfillment to Preserve Sinai</h3>
      <p>
        Covenant theology often says the Law is “fulfilled” while still functioning as the Christian rule of life. That is not fulfillment; it is reinstallation. It turns the gospel into “forgiven so you can go back to law.” When Sinai becomes the baseline of Christian life, assurance is quietly tied to performance, and holiness becomes fear-driven maintenance.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Theonomy Turns Sinai Into a Political Program</h3>
      <p>
        Theonomy attempts to universalize Israel’s covenant charter and enforce it through modern geopolitical states. Jesus completely rejects this: His kingdom is not from this world (John 18:36).
      </p>
      <p>
        The popular "moral / civil / ceremonial" division is a later theological strategy to preserve Sinai while discarding what cannot be kept. That grid is not how the Apostles argue. Scripture treats the Law as a unified package (James 2:10).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
      <p>
        In the New Creation, righteousness is not a demand hanging over you. It is a shared life in Christ. You are complete in Him (Colossians 2:10), led by the Spirit, and entirely free from the Law’s jurisdiction. Love is not law-lite; love is law transcended. Against such things there is no law—not because standards were lowered, but because the Law has nothing left to prosecute where life reigns. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Where have you measured your standing with God by Sinai-based categories rather than union with Christ?</li>
        <li>What changes when holiness is treated as Spirit-produced love rather than law-driven pressure?</li>
        <li>Which parts of your thinking are still stuck in the AD 30–70 overlap rather than the finished New Creation?</li>
