<h1>Romans 11</h1>
<h2>The Olive Tree · Remnant · Covenant Mercy</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — God Has Not Rejected His People (Romans 11:1–10)</h2>

<p><strong>11:1–2</strong> I ask then: has God rejected His people? Absolutely not. For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew.</p>

<p><strong>11:3–5</strong> Do you not know what Scripture says about Elijah — how he appeals to God against Israel? “Lord, they have killed Your prophets.” But what is God’s reply? “I have kept for Myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” So too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</p>

<p><strong>11:6–10</strong> If by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking, but the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened — as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Israel’s Stumble Serves a Purpose (Romans 11:11–24)</h2>

<p><strong>11:11–12</strong> So I ask: did they stumble so as to fall permanently? Absolutely not. Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the nations, so as to provoke Israel to jealousy.</p>

<p><strong>11:13–15</strong> I magnify my ministry to the nations in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means reconciliation for the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</p>

<p><strong>11:16–18</strong> If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches. Some of the branches were broken off, and you — a wild olive shoot — were grafted in among them and now share in the nourishing root.</p>

<p><strong>11:19–21</strong> Do not boast over the branches. You do not support the root; the root supports you. If God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare arrogant ones.</p>

<p><strong>11:22–24</strong> Consider the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but kindness toward you, provided you remain in His kindness. God is able to graft them in again.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Mystery Explained (Romans 11:25–32)</h2>

<p><strong>11:25–27</strong> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery: a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the nations has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved — as it is written, “The Deliverer will come from Zion.”</p>

<p><strong>11:28–29</strong> As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</p>

<p><strong>11:30–32</strong> Just as you were once disobedient but now have received mercy, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy. For God has bound all to disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Doxology (Romans 11:33–36)</h2>

<p><strong>11:33–36</strong> Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how unfathomable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord? From Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 11 completes Paul’s explanation of Israel and the nations.
The question is not whether Israel has been replaced,
but how God has remained faithful while expanding the covenant family.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Rejection is partial, not total</h3>
<p>
Paul explicitly denies total rejection.
A remnant remains — proof that God’s covenant faithfulness continues.
</p>

<h3>2) Hardening is temporary and purposeful</h3>
<p>
Hardening serves a redemptive function.
It opens the door for the nations and provokes Israel to reconsider Messiah.
</p>

<h3>3) “All Israel” is covenantal, not genetic</h3>
<p>
“All Israel” refers to the full covenant people —
remnant Israel plus believing nations —
the complete olive tree in Christ.
</p>

<h3>4) The olive tree never changes</h3>
<p>
There is one people of God.
Branches are removed and grafted,
but the root remains the same covenant promise.
</p>

<h3>5) Boasting is excluded on all sides</h3>
<p>
Gentile arrogance and Jewish entitlement are both dismantled.
Mercy alone defines belonging.
</p>

<h3>6) Mercy is the final word</h3>
<p>
Paul ends not with systems but with worship.
God’s plan culminates in mercy overflowing beyond expectation.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 11 eliminates replacement anxiety.
God has one people, one root, one story —
all sustained by mercy.
</p>

<p>
The New Creation family exists because God’s calling stands,
not because any group earned priority.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be tempted to boast in position or identity —
and how does Paul’s olive tree vision call me back to humility?
