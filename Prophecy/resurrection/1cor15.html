<h1>Resurrection Explained</h1>
<h2>1 Corinthians 15 — Covenant Fulfilment and New Creation Life</h2>

<p class="note">

<h2>How to Use This Page</h2>

<p>
This page explains <strong>what resurrection means</strong> in Paul’s theology,
using 1 Corinthians 15 as the controlling text.
</p>

<p>
It is a <strong>framework page</strong>, not a verse-by-verse commentary.
Its purpose is to establish the covenantal meaning of resurrection
so that Paul’s language is read consistently across Scripture.
</p>

<p>
For a phrase-by-phrase analysis of 1 Corinthians 15,

</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Problem Paul Is Addressing</h2>

<p>
Some in Corinth were denying resurrection.
This was not a debate about biology or future physics.
It was a denial that God had brought His covenant purposes to completion in Christ.
</p>

<p>
To deny resurrection was to deny:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end of the Law’s authority</li>
  <li>the defeat of sin as a ruling power</li>
  <li>the transition from death to life in the Spirit</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paul responds by showing that resurrection
is not optional theology —
it is the backbone of the gospel itself.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Resurrection in Israel’s Scriptures</h2>

<p>
Paul’s resurrection language is rooted in the Hebrew prophets.
In Scripture, resurrection most often refers to
<strong>covenant restoration</strong>, not individual corpses leaving graves.
</p>

<p>
Key background texts include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ezekiel 37</strong> — dry bones restored as Israel</li>
  <li><strong>Isaiah 26</strong> — covenant vindication described as rising</li>
  <li><strong>Daniel 12</strong> — awakening from covenant shame</li>
</ul>

<p>
These texts describe movement from judgment into life,
from exile into restoration,
from death under covenant curse into renewed identity.
</p>

<p>
Paul does not redefine resurrection.
He declares its fulfilment.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Adam and Christ: Two Covenant Realms</h2>

<blockquote>
“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all are being made alive.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Adam and Christ function as covenant heads.
They represent two realms of existence:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Adam</strong>: humanity defined by Law, sin, and death</li>
  <li><strong>Christ</strong>: humanity defined by Spirit, righteousness, and life</li>
</ul>

<p>
Resurrection, in Paul’s framework,
is transfer of identity —
from one covenant world into another.
</p>

<p>
To be “in Christ” is already to participate in resurrection life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Death, Sin, and the Law</h2>

<p>
Paul identifies the true power behind death:
</p>

<blockquote>
“The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Death is not defeated by escaping the physical world.
It is defeated by removing the Law’s authority,
which empowered sin and produced condemnation.
</p>

<p>
When the Law’s role ended,
death lost its covenant power.
</p>

<p>
Resurrection announces that this defeat has already occurred.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“The End” in 1 Corinthians 15</h2>

<p>
Paul defines “the end” explicitly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the abolition of hostile powers</li>
  <li>the completion of Christ’s reign</li>
  <li>God being all in all</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not the end of the universe.
It is the end of the old covenant world.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in the chapter suggests a cosmic shutdown.
Everything points to covenant completion.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why Resurrection Is Present Reality</h2>

<p>
Paul consistently speaks in accomplished terms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Christ <em>has been</em> raised</li>
  <li>death <em>has been</em> defeated</li>
  <li>victory <em>has been</em> given</li>
</ul>

<p>
His conclusion depends on this being true now:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Therefore… be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.”
</blockquote>

<p>
You do not ground present faithfulness
in something that has not yet happened.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1 Corinthians 15 defines resurrection covenantally</li>
  <li>Resurrection marks the transition from Law to Spirit</li>
  <li>Death’s authority has ended</li>
  <li>New Creation life is the present reality</li>
</ul>

<p>
Resurrection is not postponed hope.
It is the environment in which the Christian life now exists.
