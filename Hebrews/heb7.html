<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 7 — A Priesthood That Replaces the Old Order</h2>

<h3>Melchizedek Shows a Different Kind of Priesthood</h3>

<p>
This Melchizedek —
king of Salem,
priest of God Most High —
met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings
and blessed him.
Abraham gave him a tenth of everything
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:1–2)</a>.
</p>

<p>
His name means “king of righteousness,”
and he is also “king of Salem,” meaning “king of peace.”
Without recorded father, mother, genealogy,
without recorded beginning of days or end of life,
he resembles the Son of God
and remains a priest continually
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews is not claiming Melchizedek was a supernatural being.
The point is textual and covenantal:
the priesthood pictured here is not grounded in Levitical lineage.
It stands outside the genealogical machinery of the old covenant.
</p>

<h3>Abraham Recognised a Greater Order</h3>

<p>
Consider how great this man was:
even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the best spoils.
Levitical priests receive tithes from the people according to the law,
yet Melchizedek — not from that lineage —
received a tenth from Abraham,
and blessed the one who had the promises
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:4–6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is beyond dispute that the lesser is blessed by the greater
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:7)</a>.
In the one case, mortal men receive tithes;
in the other, one is spoken of as living
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews is arguing covenant hierarchy:
Abraham himself acknowledges a priestly order superior to Levi.
That means Levi’s system was never ultimate.
</p>

<h3>A New Priesthood Requires a New Law</h3>

<p>
If perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood
(because under it the people received the law),
what further need would there have been
for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek,
and not according to the order of Aaron?
For when the priesthood is changed,
there is necessarily a change of law as well
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:11–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is one of Hebrews’ clearest statements.
The new covenant is not a patch on the old.
A different priesthood means a different governing system.
</p>

<h3>The Son’s Priesthood Is Not Levitical</h3>

<p>
The one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe,
from which no one has served at the altar.
It is obvious that our Lord came from Judah,
and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:13–14)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This becomes even clearer
when another priest arises like Melchizedek —
one who became priest not by a law of physical descent,
but by the power of an indestructible life
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:15–16)</a>.
</p>

<p>
For Scripture testifies:
“You are a priest forever,
according to the order of Melchizedek”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA110.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 110:4)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:17)</a>.
</p>

<p>
“Forever” here means covenant permanence:
a priesthood that does not expire, rotate, or get replaced.
</p>

<h3>The Old Command Is Set Aside</h3>

<p>
A former command is set aside
because it was weak and ineffective
(for the law made nothing complete),
and a better hope is introduced,
through which we draw near to God
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:18–19)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is not anti-law as a moral idea.
It is a verdict on law as a covenant mechanism.
It could regulate, but it could not complete.
The Son’s priesthood establishes what the law could not produce:
direct approach to God as normal.
</p>

<h3>An Oath Establishes This Priesthood</h3>

<p>
And it was not without an oath.
The Levitical priests became priests without an oath,
but this one became priest with an oath
by the One who said to Him:
“The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind,
‘You are a priest forever’”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA110.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 110:4)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:20–21)</a>.
</p>

<p>
So Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:22)</a>.
</p>

<h3>A Permanent Priest Means Permanent Access</h3>

<p>
The former priests were many,
because death prevented them from continuing.
But because He remains,
He holds His priesthood permanently.
Therefore He is able to deliver completely
those who draw near to God through Him,
since He always lives to intercede for them
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:23–25)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This “intercession” is not Jesus trying to persuade an unwilling Father.
It is the ongoing priestly reality that keeps access open —
the established covenant condition in which believers live.
</p>

<h3>Finality: One Priest, Fully Qualified</h3>

<p>
Such a high priest was fitting for us:
holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners,
and exalted above the heavens.
Unlike the high priests,
He does not need to offer sacrifices day after day,
first for His own sins and then for those of the people.
He did this once for all when He offered Himself
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:26–27)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The law appoints high priests who have weakness,
but the word of the oath,
which came after the law,
appoints a Son who has been completed forever
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB07.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 7:28)</a>.
</p>

<p>
What this chapter describes is not a priesthood being introduced,
but a priesthood already established —
and with it, an old covenant mechanism already displaced.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Hebrews 7</h2>

<h3>1. Melchizedek is a covenant signpost</h3>
<p>
The argument is about priesthood type, not personal mystery.
A non-Levitical priesthood is present in Scripture before Levi exists.
That proves Levi is not ultimate.
</p>

<h3>2. Priesthood change means law change</h3>
<p>
Hebrews states it directly:
a new priesthood requires a new governing covenant.
This is not a reform; it is replacement.
</p>

<h3>3. “Forever” means permanence of office</h3>
<p>
The Son’s priesthood does not rotate or expire.
It stands as the permanent basis of access and reconciliation.
</p>

<h3>4. The old command is set aside</h3>
<p>
The law as covenant mechanism is judged “weak”
because it cannot complete.
This is why the new covenant must be established.
</p>

<h3>5. Intercession is ongoing access</h3>
<p>
Intercession means the priestly reality remains active:
approach is open, not negotiated.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews 7 makes the New Creation obvious:
a different priesthood now governs,
a different covenant now stands,
and direct approach to God is the normal condition.
