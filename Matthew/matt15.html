<h1>Matthew 15</h1>
<h2>Tradition vs. Truth and the Inward Reality of the Heart</h2>

<p class="note">

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew 15 begins with a delegation of Pharisees from Jerusalem coming to find fault with the disciples. 
Jesus uses their accusation to expose the core problem of the Old Covenant: 
<strong>The focus on external "cleanliness" was a mask for internal "uncleanliness."</strong>
</p>
<p>
This chapter reveals that the New Covenant is a matter of the heart, and that the Bread of Life is now available even to those outside the lineage of Israel.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Corruption of Tradition (15:1–9)</h3>
<p>
Pharisees from Jerusalem asked, "Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders by eating with unwashed hands?" 
Jesus countered, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? 
You nullify God's Word with your religious loops—like claiming money is 'devoted to God' just to avoid helping your parents." 
He called them hypocrites, quoting Isaiah: "These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Jesus is exposing that the "Old" system had become a fortress for self-interest rather than a conduit for God’s character.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>What Actually Defiles (15:10–20)</h3>
<p>
Jesus told the crowd, "Listen and understand: It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth—this defiles a man." 
When the disciples noted that the Pharisees were offended, He replied, "Every plant My Father hasn't planted will be uprooted. 
Leave them; they are blind leaders of the blind." 
He explained that food passes through the body, but words come from the heart—evil thoughts, theft, and lies. 
"These are what defile; eating with unwashed hands does not."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> In one sentence, Jesus legally terminates the food laws of Leviticus. In the New Creation, "purity" is not a digestive issue; it is a heart issue.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Canaanite Woman: Crumbs of the New Creation (15:21–28)</h3>
<p>
In the region of Tyre and Sidon, a Canaanite woman begged Him to heal her demon-possessed daughter. 
Jesus initially tested her, saying He was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel and that it wasn't right to give the children's bread to the dogs. 
She replied, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." 
Jesus marveled at her faith: "Great is your faith! Let it be as you desire." Her daughter was healed instantly.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "Bread" (the Kingdom) is overflowing the borders of Israel. Her faith allowed her to tap into the Finished Work before the full transition was even complete.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Healing and the Feeding of the Four Thousand (15:29–39)</h3>
<p>
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee and healed the lame, blind, and mute; the crowd glorified the God of Israel. 
He had compassion on the multitude, who had been with Him for three days without food. 
With seven loaves and a few small fish, He fed four thousand men, plus women and children. 
They gathered seven large baskets of leftovers.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Feeding the 4,000 (a Gentile number in symbolic context) mirrors the feeding of the 5,000 (Israel). The abundance of the New Creation is for all humanity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The End of the Dietary Law</h3>
<p>
By declaring that food cannot defile a man, Jesus is performing a "covenantal uprooting." 
The dietary laws were designed to keep Israel separate from the nations. 
By removing the defilement of food, Jesus is removing the wall of partition between Jew and Gentile.
</p>

<h3>2) The Uprooting of the Old System</h3>
<p>
"Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted" (v. 13). 
This is a direct reference to the religious institutions of the Pharisees. 
In the Finished Work, the "Old House" is not being renovated; it is being pulled up by the roots to make way for the New Creation.
</p>

<h3>3) Dogs and Children</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ use of "dogs" was a cultural reference to how Jews viewed Gentiles. 
However, His interaction with the woman proves that <strong>Faith is the only currency of the Kingdom.</strong> 
She understood that even the "leftovers" of Christ's authority are more than enough to handle any demonic oppression.
</p>

<h3>4) Heart vs. Hand</h3>
<p>
The Pharisees focused on the "hand" (outward performance). Jesus focuses on the "heart" (inward source). 
In the New Covenant, we don't work from the outside-in to become holy. 
We live from the inside-out because the Spirit has given us a new heart.
</p>

<h3>5) Seven Baskets of Completion</h3>
<p>
The seven large baskets remaining signify completion and wholeness. 
While the twelve baskets (Matt 14) pointed to the tribes of Israel, the seven baskets point to the world (represented by the seven Noahide nations in Jewish thought). 
The Finished Work is a global feast.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 15 frees us from the "touch not, taste not" mentality of religious performance. 
We are not made "unclean" by the world or our environment; we are made clean by the Word of Christ. 
We live as those who have been "planted by the Father," knowing that our identity is anchored in the heart, not in the observance of man-made traditions.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to "wash my hands" to be acceptable to God, or am I resting in the cleanliness He has provided in my heart?
</p>
<p>
What "traditions" am I holding onto that actually nullify the power of Grace in my life?
</p>
