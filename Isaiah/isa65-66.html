      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Book of Isaiah concludes with a breathtaking vision of cosmic renewal. Chapter 65 begins by contrasting two distinct groups: the rebellious, apostate Old Covenant nation that stubbornly clings to its own devices, and a new, unexpected people (the Gentiles) whom God calls to Himself. Because of the apostasy of the old order, God declares He is creating a "New Heavens and a New Earth." The former things (the Old Covenant system) will not be remembered. Chapter 66 then dismantles the necessity of a physical temple in Jerusalem, asking, "What is the house that you would build for me?" The book ends with the sudden, miraculous birth of a new nation—the global Church—and the gathering of all flesh to worship Yahweh.

        <span class="v-num">1</span> “I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask. I am found by those who didn’t seek me. I said, ‘See me, see me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name.<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;<br />

        <span class="v-num">19</span> I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying shall be heard in her no more.<br />
        <span class="v-num">20</span> “There shall be no more in it an infant who only lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.<br />
        <span class="v-num">21</span> They shall build houses, and inhabit them. They shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.<br />

        <span class="v-num">25</span> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,” says Yahweh.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>From Chapter 66:</strong><br />
        <span class="v-num">1</span> Yahweh says, “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? Where is the place of my rest?<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> For my hand has made all these things, and so all these things came to be,” says Yahweh: “but I will look to this man, even to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.<br />

        <span class="v-num">7</span> “Before she travailed, she gave birth. Before her pain came, she delivered a son.<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she gave birth to her children.<br />

        <span class="v-num">23</span> It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says Yahweh.

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sought by Gentiles:</strong> The Apostle Paul explicitly quotes Isaiah 65:1-2 in Romans 10:20-21 to prove that the Gentiles finding God while physical Israel rejected Him was a direct fulfillment of prophecy.</li>
        <li><strong>New Heavens & Earth:</strong> This is covenantal idiom for the New Covenant order. The Apostle John uses this exact language in Revelation 21 to describe the passing away of the Old Covenant system (AD 70) and the establishment of the New Jerusalem (the Church).</li>
        <li><strong>The Nation Born in a Day:</strong> Fulfilled at Pentecost (Acts 2), where the New Covenant "nation" (the Church) was birthed instantly through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</li>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>former things shall not be remembered</strong> — The obsolete Mosaic Covenant, with its endless animal sacrifices and genealogies, is completely surpassed and overshadowed by the glory of the New Covenant.</li>
        <li><strong>the child shall die one hundred years old</strong> — Proof that biological death still exists <em>inside</em> the New Heavens and New Earth. It is a spiritual/covenantal renewal, not a literal abolition of physical mortality.</li>
        <li><strong>heaven is my throne / footstool</strong> — God dismantling the necessity of a physical temple building. He cannot be contained in a box in the Middle East.</li>
        <li><strong>trembles at my word</strong> — The new location of God's presence. He dwells in the humble, contrite human heart, not in temples made by hands (Acts 7:48-50).</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Contrast of Two Peoples (65:1–2)</h3>
      <p>
        The conclusion of Isaiah opens with a stunning theological shift. God declares, "I am found by those who didn't seek me," referring to the Gentile nations. In contrast, He says of Israel, "I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people." 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle Paul quotes this exact passage in Romans 10:20-21. Paul is explaining why the first-century Jewish nation largely rejected the Messiah while the Gentiles flooded into the church. Paul argues this was not an accident; it was the exact fulfillment of Isaiah 65. The Old Covenant people were clinging to their own righteous works and their physical temple, while the Gentiles received the grace of God by faith.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The New Heavens and New Earth (65:17)</h3>
      <p>
        "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered." 
      </p>
      <p>
        If we read this like a modern scientist, we assume God is going to incinerate planet Earth and create a new physical globe. But as we established earlier, "heaven and earth" is ancient Hebrew idiom for a covenantal order and its temple system. The "former things" are the Old Covenant laws, the Levitical priesthood, and the physical Jerusalem. God is announcing a completely new paradigm of relationship: the New Covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why John uses this exact language in Revelation 21:1. The "first heaven and the first earth" (the old system) passed away in the fire of AD 70. The "New Jerusalem" (the Bride of Christ) came down out of heaven. 
      </p>

      <h3>3) Biological Life Inside the New Creation (65:20)</h3>
      <p>
        This verse absolutely destroys the futurist, utopian interpretation of the text. Look closely at what Isaiah says will happen <em>inside</em> the New Heavens and New Earth:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "There shall be no more in it an infant who only lives a few days... for the child shall <strong>die</strong> one hundred years old, and the <strong>sinner</strong> being one hundred years old shall be accursed."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If the New Heavens and New Earth is a literal, future, perfect planet at the end of human history, <strong>why are people still dying?</strong> Why is there still sin? Why are people still building houses and planting vineyards (v. 21)? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Isaiah is not describing the end of physical reality. He is describing a <em>new order of life</em>. It is a poetic vision of massive blessing, longevity, and stability. The curse of covenantal exile is broken. Believers live their natural, biological lives under the immense blessing and peace of the New Covenant, but physical death and the ongoing reality of sin still exist in the world.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Dismantling the Physical Temple (66:1–2)</h3>
      [Image contrasting the physical Herodian temple with a human heart]
      <p>
        God asks a rhetorical question: "What kind of house will you build for me?" The Jews placed their ultimate confidence in the massive stones of the Herodian Temple. But God declares that physical buildings cannot contain Him. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When Stephen the martyr was brought before the Sanhedrin in Acts 7, his final defense before they stoned him was to quote Isaiah 66:1. Stephen told the Jewish leaders, "The Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands." God's new dwelling place is the human heart—the man who is poor, contrite, and trembles at His word. 
      </p>

      <h3>5) A Nation Born in a Day (66:7–8)</h3>
      <p>
        "Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many modern dispensationalists claim this was fulfilled in 1948 when the modern secular state of Israel was founded. But applying this to a 20th-century geopolitical event completely misses the covenantal context. The "nation" born in a day was the <strong>New Covenant Church</strong>. On the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2), the Holy Spirit fell, 3,000 people were saved, and the true, spiritual Israel—the "holy nation" of 1 Peter 2:9—was miraculously and instantly birthed into the world.
      </p>

      <h3>6) The Global Gathering (66:18–23)</h3>
      <p>
        Isaiah ends not with destruction, but with an unstoppable, global gathering. "I will gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my glory." From new moon to new moon, all flesh shall come to worship. This is the present reality of the global Church. The worship of God is no longer confined to a single mountain in the Middle East; it is happening 24/7 across every time zone on the planet.
