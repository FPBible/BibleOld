<h1>Luke 21</h1>
<h2>The Days of Vengeance · Covenant Judgment Fulfilled</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Reading Frame (Mandatory)</strong><br />
  Luke 21 is not speculative end-times teaching.
  It is Jesus’ most explicit description of covenant judgment on Jerusalem,
  culminating in the destruction of the Temple and the end of the Old Covenant order.
  Luke removes ambiguity by naming the event:
  <span class="key">“the days of vengeance.”</span>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Temple’s destruction is the interpretive centre</li>
  <li>Judgment falls on “this people” in Jerusalem</li>
  <li>The event fulfils written prophecy</li>
  <li>The language is covenantal, not cosmological</li>
  <li>The discourse ends with exhortations to first-century vigilance</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>1) The Temple as the Covenant World</h2>

<p>
As Jesus speaks, the Temple is admired for its stones and offerings.
Jesus responds bluntly:
“The days will come when not one stone will be left upon another.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:5–6)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Fulfilled Lens</strong><br />
  The Temple was not peripheral.
  It structured Israel’s calendar, priesthood, sacrifices, and identity.
  Its destruction meant the collapse of the covenant system tied to it.
</div>

<h2>2) The Disciples’ Question: Timing, Not Cosmos</h2>

<p>
They ask:
“When will these things be,
and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:7)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Key Observation</strong><br />
  Unlike later readers, the disciples do not ask about the end of the universe.
  They ask about the Temple Jesus just mentioned.
  Luke keeps the discourse anchored to that question.
</div>

<h2>3) Preliminary Turmoil Is Not the End</h2>

<p>
Jesus lists false messiahs, wars, upheavals, and disasters,
then cautions:
“Do not be terrified; these things must take place first,
but the end will not follow immediately.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:8–9)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Clarification</strong><br />
  Jesus distinguishes between general historical unrest
  and the specific covenant judgment event.
  This prevents misidentifying every crisis as “the end.”
</div>

<h2>4) Persecution Within a Known Horizon</h2>

<p>
Jesus warns His disciples of arrest, betrayal, and persecution —
but adds:
“This will give you an opportunity to testify.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:12–13)</a>
</p>

<p>
He promises wisdom and vindication
before the event overtakes Jerusalem.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:14–19)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Audience Relevance</strong><br />
  These warnings apply directly to the first-generation disciples.
  They are not generic instructions for a distant future.
</div>

<h2>5) Jerusalem Surrounded by Armies</h2>

<p>
“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies,
then know that its desolation has come near.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:20)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Hard Historical Marker</strong><br />
  This is not symbolic language.
  It describes a real military siege —
  a clear sign to first-century believers to flee.
</div>

<h2>6) “These Are the Days of Vengeance”</h2>

<p>
“For these are the days of vengeance,
to fulfil all that is written.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:22)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Decisive Statement</strong><br />
  Luke names the event.
  These are not hypothetical judgments or partial previews.
  They are the fulfilment of written covenant warnings
  from Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms.
</div>

<h2>7) Covenant Scope: “This People”</h2>

<p>
“There will be great distress upon the land
and wrath against this people.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:23)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Scope Defined</strong><br />
  The judgment targets:
  <ul>
    <li>the land (Judea)</li>
    <li>the city (Jerusalem)</li>
    <li>the people (old covenant Israel)</li>
  </ul>
  This is covenant reckoning, not global annihilation.
</div>

<h2>8) Jerusalem Trampled Until the Transition Completes</h2>

<p>
“Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles,
until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:24)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Clarification — “Until”</strong><br />
  “Until” marks a transition point.
  It does not imply an open-ended future.
  The trampling signals the end of Jerusalem’s covenant privilege
  and the full opening of the New Covenant to the nations.
</div>

<h2>9) Cosmic Signs as Covenant Imagery</h2>

<p>
Luke echoes prophetic imagery:
signs in sun, moon, and stars;
distress of nations.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:25–26)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Symbolic Language</strong><br />
  As in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Joel,
  cosmic language describes the collapse of a ruling order.
  It is theological language, not astronomy.
</div>

<h2>10) The Son of Man “Coming”</h2>

<p>
“Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud
with power and great glory.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:27)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Royal Judgment</strong><br />
  This is Daniel 7 language:
  enthronement, authority, and vindication.
  The “coming” is Christ’s covenant verdict made visible in history,
  not a delayed physical descent.
</div>

<h2>11) Nearness Emphasised</h2>

<p>
“When these things begin to take place,
straighten up and raise your heads,
because your redemption is drawing near.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:28)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Redemption Defined</strong><br />
  Redemption here is deliverance from the old covenant system,
  not escape from the planet.
  Nearness matters — this was approaching for them.
</div>

<h2>12) The Fig Tree Lesson</h2>

<p>
“When you see these things happening,
you know that the kingdom of God is near.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:31)</a>
</p>

<p>
“Truly I say to you,
this generation will not pass away
until all things have taken place.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:32)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Time Lock</strong><br />
  Luke preserves the same time-bound fulfilment as Matthew.
  The kingdom’s manifestation in judgment occurs within that generation.
</div>

<h2>13) Watchfulness for the First Audience</h2>

<p>
Jesus warns His listeners not to be weighed down
as that day comes suddenly upon them.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/LUK21.htm">(Luke 21:34–36)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Audience Relevance</strong><br />
  These warnings only function if the event was imminent for the hearers.
  Luke offers no hint of millennia-long delay.
</div>
