      <h2>The Crisis of Modern Reading</h2>
      <p>
        When many modern readers encounter the word "Zion" in biblical prophecy, they immediately pull up a map of the modern Middle East. They look for the physical hill in the city of Jerusalem, assuming that the ultimate goal of God's redemptive plan is to return to this geographic coordinate, rebuild a physical temple, and resume ancient political boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the biblical story is not a circle; it is a trajectory. God does not move from the spiritual back to the physical. He moves from the physical (the shadow) to the spiritual (the substance). <strong>Zion is not ultimately a piece of Middle Eastern real estate; it is the covenantal centre of God's presence.</strong> Understanding the elevation of Zion from a dirt hill to the heavenly New Jerusalem is essential for grasping the finished work of Christ.
      </p>

      <h2>The History: From Fortress to Footstool</h2>
      
      <p>
        Historically, Zion began as a literal Jebusite fortress that King David conquered (2 Samuel 5:7). It became the "City of David," the political and military capital of the united monarchy. When Solomon built the Temple on the adjacent Mount Moriah, the name "Zion" expanded to encompass the entire Temple Mount area, and eventually the whole city of Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the Old Covenant, physical Zion was the "footstool" of God (Psalm 132:7). It was the singular, geographic location where the blood of atonement could be offered. If an Israelite wanted to meet with Yahweh, they had to travel to this specific physical mountain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>The Prophetic Hope: The Exalted Mountain</h2>
      <p>
        The prophets recognized that the physical hill of Zion was too small to contain the ultimate purposes of God. They began to speak of Zion not just as a location, but as an <em>exalted covenant reality</em>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it." (Isaiah 2:2)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Isaiah envisions a day when Zion is elevated above all other authorities (mountains) and the Gentiles (all nations) stream into it. Likewise, in Isaiah 25:6, God promises to host a feast "in this mountain" for all peoples, where He will permanently swallow up death. This was a radical departure from the Old Covenant, which strictly excluded Gentiles from the inner courts of the physical temple under threat of death.

      <h2>The New Covenant Reality: We Are Here</h2>
      [Image contrasting Mount Sinai with Mount Zion]
      <p>
        The author of Hebrews delivers the definitive New Testament interpretation of Zion. Writing to first-century Jewish Christians who were being tempted to abandon Christ and return to the physical temple sacrifices, he creates a stark contrast between two mountains: Sinai and Zion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire... <strong>But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem</strong>, and to innumerable multitudes of angels, to the festal gathering and assembly of the firstborn..." (Hebrews 12:18, 22-23)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Notice the tense: <em>"You have come."</em> It is a present, accomplished reality. The early church had not traveled geographically to the Middle East, nor were they waiting for a future millennium. By entering the New Covenant through the blood of Jesus, they had already arrived at the true, heavenly Mount Zion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The physical hill in Jerusalem was just the shadow; the New Covenant Church—the dwelling place of God in the Spirit—is the substance.

      <h2>Zion as the New Jerusalem</h2>
      <p>
        In the Book of Revelation, John sees the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with the 144,000 redeemed (Revelation 14:1). This is not a future military staging ground in the Middle East; it is the spiritual reality of the vindicated Church. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This reaches its climax in Revelation 21, when the Old Covenant "heaven and earth" (centered on physical Jerusalem) passes away in the judgment of AD 70, making way for the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven. The New Zion has no physical temple, "for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple" (Rev 21:22). God's presence is no longer confined to a zip code; it has flooded the entire covenant community.

      <h2>What This Is NOT Saying</h2>
      <p>
        To honor the fulfillment achieved by Jesus, we must reject interpretations that drag the Church back into the shadows of the Old Covenant.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zion is <strong>not</strong> awaiting fulfillment through modern geopolitical events in the Middle East.</li>
        <li>God is <strong>not</strong> planning to rebuild a physical temple of stone and resume animal sacrifices on a literal mountain (this would be an abomination to the finished work of Christ).</li>
        <li>Zion is <strong>not</strong> a future millennial utopia delayed by a 2,000-year parenthesis.</li>
        <li>It is the present, thriving, unshakable Kingdom of God established in the first century.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need to book a flight to the Middle East to walk where Jesus walks. You are standing on Mount Zion right now. Because the veil was torn and the Old Covenant system was removed, you have direct, unhindered access to the festal gathering of the living God. <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> The physical shadow has passed away so that the spiritual substance can remain forever. Rest in the City of God.
