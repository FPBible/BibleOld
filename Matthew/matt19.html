    <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
    <p>
      Matthew 19 continues Jesus’ covenant confrontation as He moves toward Jerusalem: questions about divorce, children, wealth, and inheritance expose how deeply the Mosaic system had distorted God’s intent, even as the New Creation order is being clarified before the AD 70 transition.

    <h2>Scripture (WEB)</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="scripture-text">
        <p>
          <span class="v-num">1</span>When Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
          <span class="v-num">2</span>Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">3</span>Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
          <span class="v-num">4</span>He answered, “Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,
          <span class="v-num">5</span>and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?’
          <span class="v-num">6</span>So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">7</span>They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a writing of divorce, and divorce her?”
          <span class="v-num">8</span>He said to them, “Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.
          <span class="v-num">9</span>I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">10</span>His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.”
          <span class="v-num">11</span>But he said to them, “Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
          <span class="v-num">12</span>For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">13</span>Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
          <span class="v-num">14</span>But Jesus said, “Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.”
          <span class="v-num">15</span>He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">16</span>Behold, one came to him and said, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?”
          <span class="v-num">17</span>He said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
          <span class="v-num">18</span>He said to him, “Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not give false testimony.’
          <span class="v-num">19</span>‘Honor your father and mother.’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">20</span>The young man said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?”
          <span class="v-num">21</span>Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”
          <span class="v-num">22</span>But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">23</span>Jesus said to his disciples, “Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
          <span class="v-num">24</span>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">25</span>When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”
          <span class="v-num">26</span>Looking at them, Jesus said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="v-num">27</span>Then Peter answered, “Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?”
          <span class="v-num">28</span>Jesus said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
          <span class="v-num">29</span>Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.
          <span class="v-num">30</span>But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.

    <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

    <h3>1) Divorce, Moses, and Covenant Concession</h3>
    <p>
      Jesus’ response to the Pharisees is not an abstract marital ethics lecture but a covenant exposure. Divorce had become a legal mechanism for control and abandonment under the Mosaic system. By appealing to creation, Jesus reveals that Moses’ allowance was a concession to covenant hardness, not God’s ideal. This distinction matters in a covenant-transition context: the old system managed sin without curing it. The New Creation restores intent by transforming hearts rather than regulating breakdown.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Kingdom Reception and the Child Paradigm</h3>
    <p>
      The welcoming of children directly rebukes covenant elitism. Under the old order, access flowed through purity codes and hierarchy. Jesus places children—those without leverage—at the center of inheritance. This anticipates the New Creation, where belonging precedes achievement and sonship replaces probation.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Wealth, Law, and False Security</h3>
    <p>
      The rich young ruler embodies covenant confusion. He assumes eternal life is acquired through law-keeping, yet his wealth anchors him to the old system’s securities. Jesus’ demand is surgical, not universalized asceticism: relinquish the asset that binds you to the dying order. Wealth here symbolizes covenant confidence apart from Christ.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Regeneration and the Judgment of Israel</h3>
    <p>
      Jesus’ promise of “regeneration” situates authority in the imminent covenant renewal. The disciples’ role in judging Israel is not future cosmic administration but first-century participation in the transition—proclaiming and embodying the New Creation as the old covenant reaches its terminus in AD 70.
    </p>

    <h3>5) First Becoming Last</h3>
    <p>
      The chapter closes with reversal language: those privileged under the Mosaic system will find themselves displaced, while those who abandon status for Christ inherit life. This is covenant recalibration, not moral posturing. The New Creation reorders everything around Christ, not pedigree or possession.
    </p>

    <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
    <p>
      Life in the Kingdom is not sustained by law, wealth, or status but by trusting participation in Christ’s finished covenant renewal, where belonging and inheritance are secure now.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      What security might Christ be asking me to release so that I live freely in the New Creation rather than clinging to a fading order?
