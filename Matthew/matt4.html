<h1>Matthew 4</h1>

<p class="note">
  Read the chapter in LSV (eBible): <a href="https://ebible.org/englsv/MAT04.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 4 — LSV</a>
</p>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew has just identified Jesus publicly as the Beloved Son (Matt 3). Now the Son is tested in the wilderness—Israel’s story replayed, but
this time faithful. After John is delivered up, Jesus relocates into “Galilee of the nations,” fulfilling Isaiah’s “great light” promise and
announcing a time-stamped Kingdom message. He then begins gathering disciples and displaying Kingdom authority through healings—signs that the
covenant transition has entered its active phase in that generation.

<h2>Scripture</h2>
<div class="scripture-text">
  <p><span class="v-num">1</span>Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">2</span>and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He hungered.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">3</span>And the tempting [one], having come to Him, said, “If You are the Son of God—speak that these stones may become loaves.”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">4</span>But He answering said, “It has been written: <strong>Man does not live on bread alone</strong>, but on every word coming forth from the mouth of God.”</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">5</span>Then the Devil takes Him to the [holy] city, and sets Him on the pinnacle of the temple,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">6</span>and says to Him, “If You are the Son of God—cast Yourself down, for it has been written that, His messengers He will charge concerning you, and on hands they will bear you up, that you may not dash your foot on a stone.”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">7</span>Jesus said to him again, “It has been written: <strong>You will not tempt the LORD your God</strong>.”</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">8</span>Again the Devil takes Him to a very high mountain, and shows to Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">9</span>and says to Him, “All these I will give to You, if falling down You may worship me.”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">10</span>Then Jesus says to him, “Go—Satan, for it has been written: <strong>You will worship the LORD your God, and Him only will you serve</strong>.”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">11</span>Then the Devil leaves Him, and behold, messengers came and were ministering to Him.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">12</span>And Jesus, having heard that John was delivered up, withdrew to Galilee,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">13</span>and having left Nazareth, having come, He dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">14</span><strong>that it might be fulfilled</strong> that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">15</span>“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">16</span>The people that is sitting in darkness saw a <strong>great light</strong>, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death—light arose to them.”</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">17</span>From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, “<strong>Convert, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near</strong>.”</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">18</span>And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a drag into the sea—for they were fishers—</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">19</span>and He says to them, “Come after Me, and I will make you <strong>fishers of men</strong>,”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">20</span>and they, immediately, having left the nets, followed Him.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">21</span>And having advanced from there, He saw two other brothers, James of Zebedee, and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, refitting their nets, and He called them,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">22</span>and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, followed Him.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">23</span>And Jesus was going in all of Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">24</span>and His fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to Him all the ill having manifold oppressing diseases and torments—and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics—and He healed them.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">25</span>And there followed Him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The wilderness testing</strong> replays Israel’s story (and the “forty” motif) but succeeds in one faithful Son—showing the old covenant failure being replaced by covenant fulfillment in Christ.</li>
  <li><strong>Temptation = shortcut kingdom</strong>: Satan offers power without obedience; Jesus refuses compromise, which frames the entire Gospel as covenant fidelity unto vindication.</li>
  <li><strong>Isaiah fulfilled</strong> anchors the ministry geographically and prophetically: the “light” rises in Galilee as the messianic dawn begins within first-century Israel.</li>
  <li><strong>“Has come near”</strong> is an imminence marker: the Kingdom’s arrival is not postponed; it presses into that generation and culminates in the end of the Mosaic age (AD 70).</li>
  <li><strong>Calling disciples</strong> is not random recruiting; it’s the beginning of the remnant-gathering mission that will carry the transition forward.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Wilderness: Israel’s Story Replayed in One Faithful Son</h3>
<p>
Matthew places the Beloved Son straight into the wilderness “by the Spirit.” This isn’t a detour; it’s covenant theater. Israel’s identity was
forged in wilderness testing, yet the nation repeatedly failed under pressure—grumbling, grasping, and substituting trust with control. Jesus
re-enters that exact symbolic space as “True Israel,” not merely as an individual proving private virtue, but as the covenant representative
who succeeds where the corporate son failed. In a fulfilled, covenantal reading, this matters because it sets up the legitimacy of the
transition: the old order is not being abolished by a stranger; it is being completed and surpassed by the faithful Son who embodies Israel’s
calling.
</p>

<h3>2) Bread: The Refusal to Build Identity on Need and Manipulation</h3>
<p>
The first temptation aims at hunger: “turn stones to loaves.” It’s more than food—it’s a test of identity and method. If Jesus uses power to
serve immediate appetite and prove sonship on demand, He turns the Kingdom into a tool for self-preservation and performance. Instead, He
quotes covenant Scripture: <strong>Man does not live on bread alone</strong>. That is a declaration that life is sourced in God’s word, not in
panic-driven control. This is a New Creation pattern: the Son refuses to live from lack. In the covenant transition, this matters because the
old world was a system of scarcity-thinking—measured righteousness, threatened status, mediated access. The faithful Son reveals a different
economy: life is not purchased by proving; it is received by trust.
</p>

<h3>3) Temple Pinnacle: The Rejection of Spectacle Religion</h3>
<p>
The second temptation relocates to the “holy city” and the temple pinnacle—right into the symbolic heart of the old covenant administration.
The devil’s tactic is religious: misuse Scripture to demand a dramatic sign. This is the spirit of the age—leaders and crowds wanting proof,
theatrics, coercive certainty. Jesus answers: <strong>You will not tempt the LORD your God</strong>. In other words: God is not an instrument
for ego, image, or institutional validation. Jesus will not build the Kingdom on “look at me” spirituality or forced deliverance displays.
</p>
<p>
Covenantally, this is huge: the temple system thrived on mediated presence and visible status. The Son refuses to use the temple as a stage.
He will not validate the old order’s categories by winning its approval. Instead, He will inaugurate a presence-centered Kingdom that will
outlast and eventually replace that entire symbolic architecture. This refusal anticipates the coming divorce between the Messiah and the
temple-world: the Kingdom will not be temple-managed.
</p>

<h3>4) Mountain of Kingdoms: No Shortcut Throne, No Compromise Covenant</h3>
<p>
The third temptation offers “all the kingdoms” through worship of the accuser. It’s the “instant reign” offer—authority without the cross,
dominion without obedience, glory without covenant fidelity. Jesus responds with covenant exclusivity: <strong>You will worship the LORD your
God, and Him only will you serve</strong>. This frames the Gospel’s entire arc: the Son receives the Kingdom by faithfulness, not by deals.
</p>
<p>
In a full-preterist, covenant framework, this is not merely moral instruction; it’s the blueprint for how the Kingdom is established in the
first century. The old world will not be overthrown by political shortcut or demonic bargain but by a faithful Messiah who completes the Law,
absorbs the curse, and is vindicated—culminating in the old covenant world’s removal and the public confirmation of His reign. The Kingdom is
not seized; it is revealed.
</p>

<h3>5) Fulfillment in Galilee: The Light Rises Where the Story Said It Would</h3>
<p>
After John is delivered up, Jesus withdraws to Galilee and settles in Capernaum, and Matthew makes it explicit: <strong>that it might be
fulfilled</strong>. The “great light” rising in Galilee is not decoration; it’s covenant proof. The prophetic storyline is landing in real
history, real geography, and real time. In the transition era, that matters because it signals that Israel’s hopes are not postponed. The
messianic dawn has begun within that generation.
</p>
<p>
Then comes the time-stamped proclamation: <strong>Convert, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near</strong>. This is not a timeless slogan.
It is a covenant deadline. The Kingdom is pressing in; the old administration is nearing its end. This “nearness” belongs to the first-century
audience and moves toward the Mosaic age’s termination (AD 70). After that climax, the Kingdom stands as settled reality: no futurist delay
needed.
</p>

<h3>6) Fishers of Men: Remnant Gathering for the Transition</h3>
<p>
Calling disciples is covenant strategy. “Fishers of men” is not “get religious recruits.” It is: gather people out of the old world into the
Messiah’s community as the transition intensifies. These men will carry the message through cities, synagogues, and opposition as the Kingdom
spreads and the old order hardens. The healings that follow (vv. 23–25) are not random kindness; they are Kingdom signs—life pushing back
against decay, wholeness invading the old system’s brokenness, and a foretaste of what New Creation life looks like when God’s reign is made
visible. In the first century, these signs authenticate the Messiah and announce that the age is changing. For us, they testify that the
Kingdom is not theory—it is authority and life.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You don’t live from pressure, spectacle, or shortcut spirituality. The faithful Son has already refused the old patterns—performance,
presumption, and compromise—and you live in His victory. The Kingdom is not “pending.” It has come near (for them) and now stands established
(for us). Your identity is not sustained by bread-alone anxiety but by the settled word of God and the indwelling life of the Spirit.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where are you still trying to prove yourself (bread), force certainty (temple), or take shortcuts (mountain)—instead of living from the quiet,
settled authority of the Beloved Son?
