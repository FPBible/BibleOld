<h1>2 Corinthians 6</h1>
<h2>Now Is the Accepted Time</h2>

<p class="hide-element note">
Original text:

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Paul continues directly from the reconciliation announcement in chapter 5.
Because reconciliation is already declared,
the appeal now is how to live faithfully inside that reality
during the ongoing collapse of the old covenant world.
</p>

<p>
This chapter is not a warning about missing a future opportunity.
It is a call to respond appropriately to a present one.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>The Time Is Now (6:1–2)</h3>

<p>
Working together with Him,
we also urge you
not to receive God’s grace in vain.
</p>

<p>
For He says,
“In a favorable time I heard you,
and in a day of salvation I helped you.”
</p>

<p>
Look —
now is the favorable time.
Now is the day of salvation.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Now” is literal. Salvation is not delayed or deferred; it is present covenant reality.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Integrity Under Pressure (6:3–10)</h3>

<p>
We put no obstacle in anyone’s path,
so that our ministry is not discredited.
</p>

<p>
Instead,
we commend ourselves as God’s servants
in everything:
</p>

<p>
in endurance,
in afflictions,
in hardships,
in pressures,
</p>

<p>
in beatings,
imprisonments,
tumults,
labors,
sleepless nights,
and hunger;
</p>

<p>
in purity,
knowledge,
patience,
kindness,
in the Holy Spirit,
in genuine love,
</p>

<p>
in truthful speech,
in the power of God,
with the weapons of righteousness
in the right hand and the left;
</p>

<p>
through honor and dishonor,
through slander and praise;
</p>

<p>
treated as impostors,
yet true;
</p>

<p>
as unknown,
yet well known;
</p>

<p>
as dying,
and yet — look — we live;
</p>

<p>
as disciplined,
yet not killed;
</p>

<p>
as sorrowful,
yet always rejoicing;
</p>

<p>
as poor,
yet enriching many;
</p>

<p>
as having nothing,
yet possessing everything.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Paul describes present experience, not heroic buildup toward future reward.
Life is already manifest within contradiction.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Open Hearts, Not Closed Loyalties (6:11–13)</h3>

<p>
Our mouth has spoken freely to you, Corinthians.
Our heart is wide open.
</p>

<p>
You are not restricted by us,
but you are restricted in your own affections.
</p>

<p>
So in return —
I speak as to children —
open wide your hearts also.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Do Not Be Bound to a Fading Order (6:14–18)</h3>

<p>
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelief.
</p>

<p>
For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness?
What fellowship has light with darkness?
</p>

<p>
What agreement has Christ with Belial?
What portion has a believer with unbelief?
</p>

<p>
What agreement has God’s temple with idols?
For we are the temple of the living God.
</p>

<p>
As God said:
“I will dwell among them and walk among them,
and I will be their God,
and they will be My people.”
</p>

<p>
“Therefore come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord,
“and touch nothing unclean;
then I will receive you.”
</p>

<p>
“And I will be a Father to you,
and you will be sons and daughters to Me,”
says the Lord Almighty.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
This is covenant separation from a dying system, not social isolation or future purity law.
The community is already God’s dwelling place.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Now” means now</h3>
<p>
Paul anchors salvation in present time.
Any reading that postpones this empties the urgency and force of the appeal.
</p>

<h3>2) Ministry is authenticated by lived integrity</h3>
<p>
Paul does not point to miracles or power displays.
He points to endurance, honesty, and Spirit-formed character
as proof that the New Covenant is real and active.
</p>

<h3>3) “Unequally yoked” is covenant language</h3>
<p>
This is not a generic rule about associations.
It is a warning against binding New Covenant life
to old covenant loyalties that are passing away.
</p>

<h3>4) The temple is already relocated</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say believers will become God’s dwelling later.
He states it as fact: “we are the temple of the living God.”
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
You are not waiting for salvation to begin.
You are living inside it.
</p>

<p>
The call is not to escape the world,
but to refuse entanglement with systems
that deny Christ’s finished work.
</p>

<p>
God does not promise future dwelling.
He announces present indwelling.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might I still be binding my identity
to structures, loyalties, or validations
that belong to a world already passing away?
