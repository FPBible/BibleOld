  <h1>Matthew 2</h1>

  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <p>Following the declaration of the King’s lineage, Matthew 2 records the world's response to the New Creation. This chapter highlights the contrast between the seeking Gentiles (Magi) and the paranoid Old Covenant stewardship (Herod). It frames Jesus as the "True Israel," retracing the Exodus journey to demonstrate that the transition from shadow to substance has formally begun.</p>

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. Recapitulation and the New Exodus</h3>
  <p>Matthew 2 is a masterpiece of covenantal recapitulation. For the Full Preterist, this chapter is a legal demonstration that Jesus is the singular "True Israel." By retracing the historical path of the nation—going down into Egypt and being called out—Jesus is "summing up" the entire story of the Old Covenant people in His own person. This was necessary because corporate Israel, as God’s "son" (Exodus 4:22), had failed to keep the covenant and was under the sentence of exile. Jesus enters the story to fulfill the requirements of the covenant perfectly. When Matthew quotes Hosea 11:1, "Out of Egypt I called My Son," he is identifying the Leader of the New Exodus. This transition period was the "forty-year" overlap between the Cross and AD 70, where the people of God were being called out of the old system and into the New Creation. By the time the Temple fell, the "True Israel" had successfully led His people into the spiritual Promised Land, where the Presence of God is no longer tied to a physical territory. This recapitulation ensures that Christ holds the legal rights to the promises made to the fathers, but expresses them in a spiritual, everlasting Kingdom rather than a fleshly one.</p>

  <h3>2. Judgment of the Old Stewardship</h3>
  <p>Herod the King serves as the ultimate type of the corrupted Old Covenant stewardship. His paranoid reaction to the "King of the Jews" reflects the state of the Jewish leadership at the time. When the text says "all Jerusalem" was troubled with him, it foreshadows the collective rejection of the Messiah that would eventually lead to the destruction of the city in AD 70. In the Preterist view, Herod is a precursor to the false authorities who clung to the physical symbols of the Old Age while the spiritual Reality was standing in their midst. The fact that the religious elite could quote Micah 5:2 but refused to follow the star highlights the spiritual blindness inherent in the Mosaic system as it reached its terminal point. The slaughter of the innocents is a tragic preview of the judgment of AD 70; the old world was dying and lashing out in violence, attempting to preserve its fleshly power against the rising Light of the New Creation. This chapter marks the "Great Divorce" beginning to manifest between the faithful remnant and the apostate structure. Herod’s death serves as a divine punctuation mark, showing that earthly kings who oppose the New Creation are ultimately removed to make way for the King of Kings.</p>

  <h3>3. The Nations and Rachel's Comfort</h3>
  <p>The arrival of the Magi is a significant marker of the covenantal shift. These Gentiles recognized the King's authority before His own people did, fulfilling the promises of the light of the nations (Isaiah 60). From a fulfilled perspective, the Magi represent the legal inclusion of the nations into the New Creation. The Kingdom was never intended to remain an ethnic, localized Hebrew entity. Similarly, Matthew’s citation of Jeremiah 31 regarding Rachel weeping signifies the birth pangs of the New Age. This weeping was the final cry of a system that could only produce death, making way for the "life more abundant" found in the King who escaped the sword. For the believer today, this means the "weeping" of the transition is over; we live in the "comfort" of a Kingdom where death has been swallowed up in victory and the old shadows are forever gone. The transition from Ramah’s weeping to the joy of the New Creation is a completed historical reality, allowing us to rest in a comfort that can never be taken away.</p>
