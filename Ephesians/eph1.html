<h1>Ephesians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1 — Chosen, Seated, and Sealed in Christ</h2>

<p>
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
to the holy and faithful who are in Christ Jesus.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing
in the heavenly realm in Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:3)</a>
</p>

<h3>Chosen and Marked Out in Christ</h3>

<p>
He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world,
to be holy and blameless before Him in love.
He marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ,
according to the good pleasure of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace,
which He freely gave us in the Beloved.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:4–6)</a>
</p>

<p>
In Him we have redemption through His blood,
the release from sins,
according to the riches of His grace,
which He lavished on us with all wisdom and insight.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:7–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Mystery of God’s Purpose Revealed</h3>

<p>
He made known to us the mystery of His will,
according to His good pleasure which He set forth in Christ,
for the administration of the fullness of the times —
to bring all things together in Christ,
things in heaven and things on earth.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:9–10)</a>
</p>

<p>
In Him we also obtained an inheritance,
having been marked out beforehand according to His purpose,
who works all things according to the counsel of His will,
so that we, who first hoped in Christ,
might exist for the praise of His glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:11–12)</a>
</p>

<h3>Sealed with the Spirit</h3>

<p>
In Him you also,
after hearing the word of truth — the gospel of your salvation —
and believing,
were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
who is the guarantee of our inheritance,
until the redemption of the purchased possession,
to the praise of His glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:13–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>Prayer for Revelation and Clarity</h3>

<p>
For this reason, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
and your love for all the saints,
I do not stop giving thanks for you,
remembering you in my prayers.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:15–16)</a>
</p>

<p>
I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of glory,
may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation
in the knowledge of Him,
so that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened,
that you may know the hope of His calling,
the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
and the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:17–19)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Exalted Christ</h3>

<p>
This is the same power He worked in Christ
when He raised Him from the dead
and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realm,
far above every ruler and authority and power and dominion,
and every name that is named,
not only in this age but also in the one that was coming.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:20–21)</a>
</p>

<p>
He placed all things under His feet
and gave Him as head over all things to the body,
which is His fullness —
the fullness of Him who fills all things in every way.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:22–23)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 1</h2>

<h3>1) “Every spiritual blessing” means nothing essential is missing</h3>
<p>
Paul does not speak in future tense.
The believer is not waiting to receive blessings —
they already exist in Christ.
This removes the entire spirituality of lack.
Prayer is not begging for what God withheld,
but alignment with what He has already given.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:3)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Election is Christ-centred, not fate-driven</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say individuals were chosen apart from Christ.
He says God chose <em>in Him</em>.
Christ is the elect One,
and participation in Him defines election.
This preserves assurance without turning God into a cosmic dice-roller.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:4–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Adoption replaces performance-based belonging</h3>
<p>
Adoption is family language, not legal probation.
It announces belonging before behaviour.
This ends the religious instinct to prove worthiness.
The New Creation begins from sonship, not toward it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:5)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Redemption is release, not postponed forgiveness</h3>
<p>
Paul defines redemption as the release from sins.
Not partial relief.
Not conditional pardon.
Release.
This is why accusation has no jurisdiction in the New Creation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:7)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) The mystery is cosmic reconciliation, not private spirituality</h3>
<p>
God’s revealed plan is the unification of heaven and earth in Christ.
This is covenantal language —
the collapse of divided realms.
What was once separated by law, priesthood, and distance
is now gathered into one reality in the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:9–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) The Spirit’s seal is assurance, not delay</h3>
<p>
The Spirit is not a down payment implying absence.
He is the guarantee that the inheritance belongs to this order.
The New Creation is not waiting to begin;
it is already marked out and secured.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:13–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Enthronement language is present, not postponed</h3>
<p>
Christ is already seated above every authority.
This is not future speculation —
it is the operating reality of the New Creation.
Paul’s prayer is not that Christ would reign,
but that believers would see that He does.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:20–21)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) The Church is not a tool — it is Christ’s fullness</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say the Church <em>represents</em> Christ.
He says it is His fullness.
That means the presence of the exalted Christ is expressed in a people.
This finishes temple theology permanently.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:22–23)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 1 establishes the New Creation constitution:
blessed, chosen, adopted, redeemed, sealed, and seated.
Nothing here is provisional.
Nothing here is delayed.
Everything here is meant to be seen.
