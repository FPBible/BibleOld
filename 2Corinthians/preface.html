<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read Second Corinthians</h2>

<p>
Second Corinthians is not a systematic theology letter.
It is a lived letter — written in the aftermath of conflict,
misunderstanding,
and the collapse of old religious authority.
</p>

<p>
Paul is not defending a future hope.
He is explaining how life works
now that the New Covenant has arrived
and the old covenant world is losing its hold.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. This Letter Lives After the Veil Is Removed</h2>

<p>
One of the central images in this letter is the removal of the veil.
This is not a psychological metaphor
and not an individual religious experience.
</p>

<p>
The veil represents the old covenant mode of access —
mediated, fading, and temporary.
Paul writes after that veil has been removed in Christ.
</p>

<p>
This means the letter must be read
from the standpoint of open access,
shared glory,
and unveiled participation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Glory Has Replaced Glory</h2>

<p>
Second Corinthians contrasts two forms of glory:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fading glory tied to tablets, letters, and condemnation</li>
  <li>a surpassing glory tied to the Spirit and life</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paul is not describing two coexisting systems.
He is announcing a completed transition.
</p>

<p>
The glory associated with the Law
is presented as already surpassed,
already fading,
and no longer defining God’s people.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Weakness Is Not Failure</h2>

<p>
This letter redefines power.
</p>

<p>
Paul’s suffering, weakness, and affliction
are not signs of divine absence.
They are signs that old measures of authority
no longer apply.
</p>

<p>
In the New Covenant,
power is not displayed through domination,
status,
or religious performance,
but through participation in Christ’s self-giving life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Judgment Language Is Covenant Language</h2>

<p>
Second Corinthians contains warnings,
confrontations,
and sharp language.
</p>

<p>
These are not threats of end-of-world punishment.
They belong to a covenant transition
where old patterns of authority,
boasting,
and accusation are being exposed and dismantled.
</p>

<p>
Paul’s concern is not future condemnation,
but present alignment with the reality
already established in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. How This Bible Is Presented</h2>

<p>
In this Fulfilled Prophecy Bible:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language that sounds future-oriented is rendered as fulfilled or imminent within Paul’s world</li>
  <li>Covenant terms are treated as covenant terms, not abstract spirituality</li>
  <li>The text stands on its own without needing commentary to correct it</li>
  <li>Original Scripture links are provided where language is clarified or expanded</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commentary sections exist to explain context,
not to rescue unfinished theology.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6. How to Use This Book</h2>

<p>
Read slowly.
Notice repeated contrasts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>letter vs Spirit</li>
  <li>boasting vs humility</li>
  <li>appearance vs reality</li>
  <li>old authority vs new life</li>
</ul>

<p>
Second Corinthians is an invitation
to stop measuring life by fading standards
and to live from unveiled participation in Christ.
</p>
