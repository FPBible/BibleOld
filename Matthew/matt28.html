<h1>Matthew 28 — Resurrection, Authority, and the Mission Completed</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew 28 concludes the Gospel by revealing the Father’s public vindication of Jesus, the collapse of the old guard’s authority,
and the commissioning of the New Covenant people as the Spirit-filled witnesses who would carry the Kingdom through the
first-century transition until the Mosaic age was fully brought to its end.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scripture (WEB)</h2>
<div class="scripture-text">

<p>
<span class="v-num">1</span>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
<span class="v-num">2</span>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
<span class="v-num">3</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
<span class="v-num">4</span>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="v-num">5</span>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
<span class="v-num">6</span>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
<span class="v-num">7</span>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="v-num">8</span>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
<span class="v-num">9</span>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<span class="v-num">10</span>Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="v-num">11</span>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.
<span class="v-num">12</span>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
<span class="v-num">13</span>saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
<span class="v-num">14</span>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
<span class="v-num">15</span>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.
</p>

<p>
<span class="v-num">16</span>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
<span class="v-num">17</span>When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="v-num">18</span>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, “<strong>All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</strong>
<span class="v-num">19</span>Go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
<span class="v-num">20</span>teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, <strong>I am with you always, even to the end of the age.</strong>”

<h2>Fulfillment Notes (STRICT)</h2>
<p class="note">The resurrection publicly vindicates Jesus as Messiah and Judge of the covenant order.</p>
<p class="note">The false report confirms leadership resistance even after decisive divine action.</p>
<p class="note">“All authority” announces completed enthronement, not a future coronation.</p>
<p class="note">The mission unfolds within the first-century horizon leading to the end of the Mosaic age.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Annotations</h2>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth:</strong> Total covenant authority over both Temple (“heaven”) and Land (“earth”).</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>I am with you always:</strong> Covenant presence replacing Temple-mediated access.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>the end of the age:</strong> The conclusion of the Mosaic covenant system in AD 70.</div>
</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Resurrection as Covenant Vindication</h3>
<p>
Matthew does not present the resurrection as an abstract miracle or merely personal hope for the afterlife. It is a public,
historical vindication of Jesus’ authority claims against the Temple system. The earthquake, angelic descent, and terrified
guards all signal that the old guardians of power have lost control. The resurrection announces that the covenant lawsuit
has been decided in heaven, and the verdict now stands awaiting its earthly outworking.
</p>

<h3>2) The Collapse of the Old Guard’s Credibility</h3>
<p>
The bribing of the guards is deliberate narrative irony. The leadership that demanded truth at trial now purchases lies to
protect its collapsing authority. Matthew records this not to explain away skepticism, but to expose the moral bankruptcy
of the Temple regime. The resurrection does not produce repentance in the system; it hardens it. This seals the necessity
of judgment within that generation.
</p>

<h3>3) Authority Fully Transferred</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ declaration that all authority has been given to Him is not future-oriented. In Daniel 7 terms, this is the moment
of enthronement. Authority over “heaven and earth” means the entire covenant structure—Temple, Law, priesthood, and land
administration—is now under the Son of Man. Nothing remains pending.
</p>

<h3>4) The Mission and Its Timeframe</h3>
<p>
The Great Commission is not detached from Matthew 24. The mission unfolds before “the end of the age,” not after it.
The apostles would take the gospel to the nations during the final forty-year transition period, culminating in the
removal of the old order. This is why the book of Acts ends before AD 70—the mission had reached maturity.
</p>

<h3>5) Presence Replaces Temple</h3>
<p>
“I am with you always” is the final blow to Temple theology. God’s presence is no longer located, mediated, or restricted.
The risen Christ dwells with His people directly. When the Temple fell, nothing was lost—because nothing essential remained
there.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You are not waiting for authority to be granted or presence to arrive. The Kingdom is established, Christ is enthroned,
and God is with His people without mediation. Life now flows from union, not anticipation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where are you still living as if authority or presence is delayed, instead of resting in the finished reign of Christ?
