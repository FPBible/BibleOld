  <h1>Matthew 2</h1>

  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <p>Following the declaration of the King’s lineage, Matthew 2 records the world's response to the New Creation. This chapter highlights the contrast between the seeking Gentiles (Magi) and the paranoid Old Covenant stewardship (Herod). It frames Jesus as the "True Israel," retracing the Exodus journey to demonstrate that the transition from shadow to substance has formally begun.</p>

  <div class="scripture-text">
    <span class="v-num">1</span>Now after Jesus was born in <strong>Bethlehem</strong> of Judea in the days of <strong>Herod the king</strong>, behold, <strong>wise men</strong> from the East arrived in Jerusalem, <span class="v-num">2</span>saying, “Where is He who was born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the East and came to do Him homage.” <span class="v-num">3</span>And Herod the king having heard, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him, <span class="v-num">4</span>and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring of them where the Christ is born. <span class="v-num">5</span>And they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet: <span class="v-num">6</span>And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, you are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you will come forth a Leader who will shepherd My people Israel.” <span class="v-num">7</span>Then Herod, having privately called the wise men, inquired exactly of them the time of the appearing star, <span class="v-num">8</span>and having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Having gone, inquire exactly for the child, and when you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come, may do him homage.” <span class="v-num">9</span>And they, having heard the king, departed, and behold, the star, which they saw in the East, was going before them, until, having come, it stood over where the child was. <span class="v-num">10</span>And having seen the star, they rejoiced with very great joy, <span class="v-num">11</span>and having come into the house, they found the child with Mary His mother, and having fallen down they did him homage, and having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh; <span class="v-num">12</span>and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back to Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region. <span class="v-num">13</span>And on their having withdrawn, behold, a messenger of the LORD appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Having risen, take the child and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.” <span class="v-num">14</span>And he, having risen, took the child and His mother by night, and withdrew into Egypt, <span class="v-num">15</span>and he was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that which was spoken by the LORD through the prophet, saying, “<strong>Out of Egypt I called My Son</strong>.” <span class="v-num">16</span>Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the wise men, was very wroth, and having sent forth, he slew all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the wise men. <span class="v-num">17</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, <span class="v-num">18</span>“A voice in Ramah was heard—lamentation, and weeping, and much mourning—<strong>Rachel weeping [for] her children</strong>, and she would not be comforted, because they are not.” <span class="v-num">19</span>And Herod having died, behold, a messenger of the LORD in a dream appears to Joseph in Egypt, <span class="v-num">20</span>saying, “Having risen, take the child and His mother, and be going into the land of Israel, for they have died who are seeking the life of the child.” <span class="v-num">21</span>And he, having risen, took the child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel, <span class="v-num">22</span>and having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee, <span class="v-num">23</span>and having come, he dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets, that “He will be called a Nazarene.”

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. Recapitulation and the New Exodus</h3>
  <p>Matthew 2 is a masterpiece of covenantal recapitulation. For the Full Preterist, this chapter is a legal demonstration that Jesus is the singular "True Israel". By retracing the historical path of the nation—going down into Egypt and being called out—Jesus is "summing up" the entire story of the Old Covenant people in His own person. This was necessary because corporate Israel had failed to keep the covenant. Jesus enters the story to fulfill the requirements of the covenant perfectly. When Matthew quotes Hosea 11:1, "Out of Egypt I called My Son," he is identifying the Leader of the New Exodus. This transition period was the "forty-year" overlap between the Cross and AD 70, where the people of God were being called out of the old system and into the New Creation. By the time the Temple fell, the "True Israel" had successfully led His people into the spiritual Promised Land, where the Presence of God is no longer tied to a physical territory. This recapitulation ensures that Christ holds the legal rights to the promises made to the fathers, but expresses them in a spiritual, everlasting Kingdom rather than a fleshly one.</p>

  <h3>2. Judgment of the Old Stewardship</h3>
  <p>Herod the King serves as the ultimate type of the corrupted Old Covenant stewardship. His paranoid reaction to the "King of the Jews" reflects the state of the Jewish leadership at the time. When the text says "all Jerusalem" was troubled with him, it foreshadows the collective rejection of the Messiah that led to the city's destruction in AD 70. In the Preterist view, Herod is a precursor to the false authorities who clung to physical symbols while the spiritual Reality stood in their midst. The fact that the religious elite could quote Micah 5:2 but refused to follow the star highlights the spiritual blindness inherent in the Mosaic system. The slaughter of the innocents is a tragic preview of the judgment of AD 70; the old world was dying and lashing out in violence, attempting to preserve fleshly power against the rising Light of the New Creation. This chapter marks the "Great Divorce" beginning to manifest between the faithful remnant and the apostate structure. Herod’s death serves as a divine punctuation mark, showing that earthly kings who oppose the New Creation are removed to make way for the King of Kings.</p>

  <h3>3. The Nations and Rachel's Comfort</h3>
  <p>The arrival of the Magi is a significant marker of the covenantal shift. These Gentiles recognized the King's authority before His own people did, fulfilling the promises of the light of the nations. From a fulfilled perspective, the Magi represent the legal inclusion of the nations into the New Creation. The Kingdom was never intended to remain an ethnic, localized Hebrew entity. Similarly, Matthew’s citation of Jeremiah 31 regarding Rachel weeping signifies the birth pangs of the New Age. This weeping was the final cry of a system that could only produce death, making way for the "life more abundant" found in the King who escaped the sword. For the believer today, this means the "weeping" of the transition is over; we live in the "comfort" of a Kingdom where death has been swallowed up in victory and the old shadows are forever gone. The transition from Ramah’s weeping to the joy of the New Creation is a completed historical reality. We rest in a comfort that can never be taken away.</p>
