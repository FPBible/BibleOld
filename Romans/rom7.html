<h1>Romans 7</h1>
<h2>Released from the Law — The Old Marriage Ended</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Death Ends Covenant Obligation (Romans 7:1–6)</h2>

<p><strong>7:1–3</strong> Do you not know, brothers and sisters — for I am speaking to those who know the Law — that the Law has authority over a person only as long as they live? A married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</p>

<p><strong>7:4–6</strong> In the same way, you also were put to death to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might belong to another — to Him who was raised from the dead — in order that we might bear fruit for God. While we were in the flesh, sinful passions aroused by the Law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. But now we have been released from the Law, having died to what held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the letter.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Law Exposes Sin (Romans 7:7–13)</h2>

<p><strong>7:7–8</strong> What then shall we say? Is the Law sin? Absolutely not. Yet I would not have known sin except through the Law. I would not have known coveting if the Law had not said, “You shall not covet.” But sin, seizing opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting.</p>

<p><strong>7:9–11</strong> I was once alive apart from the Law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. The commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, seizing opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and killed me through it.</p>

<p><strong>7:12–13</strong> So the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good. Did what is good become death to me? Absolutely not. Sin did this, so that sin might be shown to be sin by producing death through what is good — in order that sin might become utterly sinful through the commandment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Life Under Law Described (Romans 7:14–25)</h2>

<p><strong>7:14–17</strong> We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin. I do not understand my own actions. For what I want to do, I do not do — but what I hate, that is what I practice. If I do what I do not want, I agree that the Law is good. But now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.</p>

<p><strong>7:18–20</strong> For I know that nothing good dwells in me — that is, in my flesh. The desire to do good is present with me, but the ability to carry it out is not. For the good I want to do, I do not do; but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</p>

<p><strong>7:21–23</strong> So I find this law at work: when I want to do good, evil is right there with me. I delight in God’s law in my inner being, but I see another law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.</p>

<p><strong>7:24–25</strong> Wretched person that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 7 is written to people who “know the Law.”
Paul is not describing normal Christian life.
He is describing life under the Law — a divided existence where desire and ability are at odds.
This chapter explains why release from Law was necessary.
</p>

<p>
Romans 6 explained <em>freedom from sin’s mastery</em>.
Romans 7 explains <em>freedom from Law’s jurisdiction</em>.
Romans 8 will show life beyond both.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Death ends covenant obligation</h3>
<p>
Paul’s marriage analogy is unambiguous.
Death dissolves legal bonds.
Believers died with Christ, and therefore the Law’s authority ended.
This is not reform — it is termination.
</p>

<h3>2) Release from Law enables union with Christ</h3>
<p>
The goal is not lawlessness.
The goal is remarriage.
Only by dying to the old covenant could believers belong to the risen Christ
and bear fruit in a new way.
</p>

<h3>3) The Law is good — but lethal to sinners</h3>
<p>
Paul carefully defends the Law’s goodness.
The problem is not Torah.
The problem is sin exploiting Torah.
The Law names sin but cannot cure it.
</p>

<h3>4) Romans 7:14–25 is not Christian norm</h3>
<p>
This passage describes a trapped conscience.
Delight in the Law without the power to fulfill it results in despair.
If this were Christian life, Romans 8 would contradict it.
Instead, Romans 7 explains why deliverance is required.
</p>

<h3>5) “Wretched” is the voice of the old covenant</h3>
<p>
This cry echoes Israel’s prophetic lament under condemnation.
It is the language of exile and death — not resurrection life.
The answer comes immediately: deliverance through Jesus Christ.
</p>

<h3>6) The chapter ends pointing forward, not settling in defeat</h3>
<p>
Romans 7 does not conclude with despair.
It hands the reader off to Romans 8.
The struggle is explained so that freedom can be announced.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be interpreting struggle as identity —
and what would change if I embraced full release into life in the Spirit?
