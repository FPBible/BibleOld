<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy Bible + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>
<hr/><section id="scripture">
<div class="scripture-text">
“Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.<br />
<br />
In my Father’s house are many homes. If it weren’t so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.<br />
<br />
If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.<br />
<br />
You know where I go, and you know the way.”<br />
<br />
Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”<br />
<br />
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.<br />
<br />
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.”<br />
<br />
Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”<br />
<br />
Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’<br />
<br />
Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.<br />
<br />
Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.<br />
<br />
Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.<br />
<br />
Whatever you will ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br />
<br />
If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.<br />
<br />
If you love me, keep my commandments.<br />
<br />
I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever:<br />
<br />
the Spirit of truth, whom the world can’t receive; for it doesn’t see him and doesn’t know him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.<br />
<br />
I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.<br />
<br />
Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.<br />
<br />
In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.<br />
<br />
One who has my commandments and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him.”<br />
<br />
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”<br />
<br />
Jesus answered him, “If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.<br />
<br />
He who doesn’t love me doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the Father’s who sent me.<br />
<br />
I have said these things to you while still living with you.<br />
<br />
But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.<br />
<br />
Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Don’t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.<br />
<br />
You heard how I told you, ‘I go away, and I come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater than I.<br />
<br />
Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens, you may believe.<br />
<br />
I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.<br />
<br />
But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let’s go from here.

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, privately instructing His disciples</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The disciples on the night before the crucifixion</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The transfer of God’s dwelling from temple and teacher to Spirit and union</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> The disciples are being prepared for covenant transition — loss of visible presence, gain of internal life.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) “Many dwelling places” is covenant, not real estate</h3>
<p>Jesus is not describing heavenly housing. “Father’s house” refers to God’s covenant household. The “dwelling places” are people brought into permanent union, not rooms built in the sky.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>Access to God mediated by temple, priesthood, and physical proximity to Jesus in the flesh.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Direct access to the Father through the Son, with God dwelling within His people by the Spirit.</p>
<h3>4) “I will come again”</h3>
<p>This is not a distant cosmic return. It refers to Jesus’ post-resurrection presence through the Spirit and His covenant vindication within that generation.</p>
<h3>5) The Spirit as permanent indwelling</h3>
<p>The Helper is not a temporary substitute. The Spirit remains forever, marking the end of exile and the beginning of New Creation life.</p>
<h3>6) Greater works</h3>
<p>The “greater works” are not more spectacular miracles, but the expansion of covenant life beyond Israel through Spirit-empowered witness.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The promises of presence, peace, and union are realized through resurrection, Pentecost, and the public removal of the temple-centered system in AD 70.</p>
