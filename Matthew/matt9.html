<h1>Matthew 9</h1>
<h2>New Wine, New Skins</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The conflict deepens. Jesus is no longer just healing bodies; He is claiming the prerogatives of God Himself—specifically the authority to forgive sins apart from the Temple sacrifices. As the religious leaders accuse Him of blasphemy, Jesus escalates the tension by declaring that His movement is incompatible with their traditions. The "Old Wineskin" of Judaism cannot hold the "New Wine" of the Kingdom; a total structural change is required.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> And having entered into the boat, he passed over, and came to his own city,
    <span class="v-num">2</span> and lo, they were bringing to him a paralytic, laid upon a couch, and Jesus having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, “Be of good courage, child, thy sins have been forgiven thee.”
    <span class="v-num">3</span> And lo, certain of the scribes said within themselves, “This one doth blaspheme.”
    <span class="v-num">4</span> And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, “Why think ye evil in your hearts?
    <span class="v-num">5</span> For which is easier? To say, Thy sins have been forgiven? Or to say, Rise and walk?
    <span class="v-num">6</span> But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority upon the earth to forgive sins—(then saith he to the paralytic)—having risen, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.”
    <span class="v-num">7</span> And having risen, he went to his house,
    <span class="v-num">8</span> and the multitudes having seen, wondered, and glorified God, who gave such authority to men.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">9</span> And Jesus passing forth thence, saw a man sitting at the tax-office, named Matthew, and saith to him, “Follow me;” and he having risen, followed him.
    <span class="v-num">10</span> And it came to pass, he reclining (at meat) in the house, that lo, many tax-gatherers and sinners having come, were reclining (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples,
    <span class="v-num">11</span> and the Pharisees having seen, said to his disciples, “Wherefore with tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher eat?”
    <span class="v-num">12</span> And Jesus having heard, said to them, “They who are whole have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;
    <span class="v-num">13</span> but having gone, learn ye what is, Kindness I will, and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call righteous men, but sinners to reformation.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">14</span> Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, “Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?”
    <span class="v-num">15</span> And Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? But days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast.
    <span class="v-num">16</span> And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment, for its filling up doth take from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
    <span class="v-num">17</span> Nor do they put new wine into old skins, and if not—the skins burst, and the wine doth run out, and the skins are destroyed, but they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">18</span> While he is speaking these things to them, lo, a ruler having come, was bowing to him, saying, “My daughter just now died, but having come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.”
    <span class="v-num">19</span> And Jesus having risen, followed him, also his disciples;
    <span class="v-num">20</span> and lo, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, having come to him behind, touched the fringe of his garment,
    <span class="v-num">21</span> for she said within herself, “If only I may touch his garment, I shall be saved.”
    <span class="v-num">22</span> And Jesus having turned about, and seen her, said, “Be of good courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee;” and the woman was saved from that hour.
    <span class="v-num">23</span> And Jesus having come into the house of the ruler, and having seen the minstrels and the multitude making a tumult,
    <span class="v-num">24</span> he saith to them, “Withdraw, for the damsel did not die, but doth sleep,” and they were deriding him;
    <span class="v-num">25</span> but when the multitude was put forth, having gone in, he took hold of her hand, and the damsel arose;
    <span class="v-num">26</span> and the fame of this went forth into all that land.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">27</span> And Jesus passing on thence, two blind men followed him, calling and saying, “Deal kindly with us, Son of David.”
    <span class="v-num">28</span> And he having come to the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus saith to them, “Believe ye that I am able to do this?” They say to him, “Yes, Lord.”
    <span class="v-num">29</span> Then touched he their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be to you,”
    <span class="v-num">30</span> and their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, “See, let no one know;”
    <span class="v-num">31</span> but they, having gone forth, did spread his fame in all that land.
    <span class="v-num">32</span> And as they are coming forth, lo, they brought to him a man dumb, a demoniac,
    <span class="v-num">33</span> and the demon having been cast out, the dumb spake, and the multitudes wondered, saying, “It was never so seen in Israel.”
    <span class="v-num">34</span> But the Pharisees said, “By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">35</span> And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every sickness and every malady among the people.
    <span class="v-num">36</span> And having seen the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, that they were faint and cast aside, as sheep not having a shepherd,
    <span class="v-num">37</span> then saith he to his disciples, “The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few;
    <span class="v-num">38</span> beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he may put forth workmen to his harvest.”

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>9:6 — Authority on earth:</strong> The central conflict. The Pharisees believed only the Temple (heaven's representative) could manage sin. Jesus claims that jurisdiction for Himself, bypassing the priesthood.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>9:13 — Mercy, not sacrifice:</strong> A quote from Hosea 6:6. Jesus is not just tweaking the Law; He is prioritizing the prophetic demand for heart-reality over the Levitical cultus.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>9:17 — New Wine into Old Skins:</strong> The theological core of the chapter. The "New Wine" is the Spirit/New Covenant. The "Old Skins" is the Mosaic Law system. They cannot be mixed.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>9:37 — The harvest:</strong> Refers to the end of the age (see Matt 13:39). The "reaping" of the faithful Remnant was beginning, and the time was short.</div>
</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Bypassing the Temple</h3>
<p>
When Jesus forgives the paralytic (v. 2), He commits a deliberate act of war against the Temple system. In the Old Covenant, forgiveness required a trip to Jerusalem, a priest, and a blood sacrifice. Jesus offers it right there, in a house, based solely on His own authority. This signals that the Temple's function is obsolete. The "House" of God is no longer a building in Jerusalem; it is the person of the Son.
</p>

<h3>2) The Incompatibility of Covenants</h3>
<p>
The parable of the Wineskins (vv. 16-17) is the death knell for "Judeo-Christianity" or "Messianic Judaism" that tries to keep the Law while following Jesus. Jesus explicitly states that you cannot patch the "Old Garment" (Judaism) with the New Cloth. You cannot pour the "New Wine" (Spirit-filled life) into the "Old Wineskin" (the rigid Levitical structure). If you try, <em>both</em> are ruined. The Old Wineskin must be discarded so the New Wine can be preserved in a New Wineskin (the Church/New Jerusalem).
</p>

<h3>3) The Bridegroom and the Crisis</h3>
<p>
Jesus refers to Himself as the Bridegroom (v. 15), identifying with Yahweh, the husband of Israel. He mentions days when He will be "taken away"—a reference to the Cross and Ascension. This inaugurated the transitional period where the "friends of the Bridegroom" (the disciples) would fast and work frantically to gather the harvest before the Wedding Feast was fully consummated at the destruction of the Harlot City (Rev 19).
</p>

<h3>4) Sheep Without a Shepherd</h3>
<p>
Verse 36 paints a tragic picture of first-century Israel: "faint and cast aside." The religious leaders (Pharisees/Sadducees) were not shepherding the flock; they were fleecing it. This creates the urgency for the "Harvest" (v. 37). The judgment was coming, the leaders were corrupt, and the true sheep needed to be gathered into the fold of the Great Shepherd immediately. This "harvest" was the gathering of the Remnant in the generation of AD 30-70.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
We drink the New Wine in the New Wineskin. We do not look back to the rigid forms of the Old Law for our structure, nor do we need a priest to mediate our forgiveness. We live in the flexibility and joy of the Spirit, celebrating that the Bridegroom is no longer "taken away" but is present with us forever in the New Jerusalem.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I trying to patch up my old life with a little bit of Jesus (putting new cloth on an old garment), or have I allowed Him to give me an entirely new structure (wineskin) to hold His life?
