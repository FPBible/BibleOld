<h1>Matthew 3</h1>

<p class="note">
  Read the chapter in LSV (eBible): <a href="https://ebible.org/englsv/MAT03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 3 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
John appears as the final prophetic herald to Israel under the Mosaic administration. His message is urgent and time-stamped:
the Kingdom is near, the axe is already placed, and a covenant sorting is about to occur. The chapter then identifies Jesus publicly as the
Beloved Son—true Israel and true King—who will fulfill righteousness and bring the age of shadow to its appointed end.
</p>

<h2>Scripture</h2>
<div class="scripture-text">
  <p><span class="v-num">1</span>And in those days comes John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">2</span>and saying, “<strong>Repent, for the Kingdom of the Heavens has come near</strong>,”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">3</span>for this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the LORD, make His paths straight.”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">4</span>And this John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">5</span>Then were going forth to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">6</span>and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">7</span>And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “<strong>Brood of vipers</strong>! Who warned you to flee from the <strong>coming wrath</strong>?</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">8</span>Yield, then, fruit worthy of the repentance,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">9</span>and do not think to say in yourselves, We have a father—Abraham; for I say to you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">10</span>And <strong>already also the axe is laid to the root of the trees</strong>; every tree, then, not yielding good fruit is cut down and cast into fire.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">11</span>I indeed baptize you in water to repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, He will baptize you in the <strong>Holy Spirit and fire</strong>,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">12</span>whose <strong>winnowing shovel</strong> is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor, and will gather His wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">13</span>Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">14</span>but John was forbidding Him, saying, “I have need by You to be baptized—and You come to me?”</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">15</span>And Jesus answering said to him, “Permit now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness”; then he permits Him.</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">16</span>And having been baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him,</p>
  <p><span class="v-num">17</span>and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “<strong>This is My Son—the Beloved</strong>, in whom I did delight.”</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Imminence:</strong> “has come near” and “already” are first-century time stamps—this is not distant futurism.</li>
  <li><strong>Wrath:</strong> “coming wrath” is covenant judgment upon Jerusalem and its temple-world, reaching its climax in AD 70.</li>
  <li><strong>Fire:</strong> the “unquenchable fire” imagery aligns with covenant burning/removal of the old order, not a new future timeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation:</strong> winnowing describes the sorting of Israel during the transition era (wheat gathered; chaff burned).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Kingdom “Near” as Covenant Chronology (Not Vague Spirituality)</h3>
<p>
John’s opening line is not general religious motivation: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the Heavens has come near.” The phrase “has come near”
functions as covenant chronology. John is announcing that Israel’s covenant world—defined by Torah administration, temple status, priestly
gatekeeping, and genealogical confidence—is at its turning point. In prophetic terms, this is the end-phase of the Mosaic age. The Kingdom is
not “far away,” and it is not “delayed.” It presses into that generation as an immediate reality requiring an immediate response.
</p>
<p>
This is why repentance is framed as a decisive turning. John is not saying, “Try harder to keep the old system.” He is saying, “Turn, because
the old system is about to be judged and replaced in practice by the Messiah’s reign.” Repentance here is covenant reorientation: a change of
mind about where life, identity, and righteousness truly stand. It is preparation to step out of the shadow-world and into the Messiah’s
reality.
</p>

<h3>2) “Brood of Vipers”: The Covenant Lawsuit Against Corrupt Leadership</h3>
<p>
John targets Pharisees and Sadducees because they represent the leadership structures maintaining the old order. “Brood of vipers” is not
name-calling for sport; it’s prophetic exposure. In Israel’s Scriptures, covenant-breaking leadership is repeatedly portrayed as corrupt,
poisonous, and predatory—using God’s words to preserve power while resisting God’s purpose. John’s accusation places them on the wrong side of
the covenant story: they are resisting the very Kingdom they claim to serve.
</p>
<p>
This is why John immediately mentions “the coming wrath.” Wrath here is covenant outcome—the judicial consequence of persistent rejection.
Israel had long lived under prophetic warnings: when covenant is violated and the leadership hardens, judgment comes. John’s warning is not
aimed at the end of the physical planet. It is aimed at the impending covenant crisis of that generation, where Jerusalem’s temple-world would
be measured, found wanting, and removed.
</p>

<h3>3) “Already the Axe”: The Old Tree Marked for Removal</h3>
<p>
Verse 10 is brutally specific: “already also the axe is laid to the root of the trees.” “Already” means the process is not theoretical. The
old “trees” are not simply individuals making mistakes; the image points to a covenant orchard—an institutional system that claims to be God’s
planting while refusing covenant fruit. John says the axe is at the root. That is systemic judgment language.
</p>
<p>
So when John speaks of trees cut down and cast into fire, he is talking about the removal of a covenant administration that had reached its
appointed end. The Mosaic age was a temporary tutor, not the final reality. It could expose sin, but not end it; it could appoint sacrifices,
but not perfect conscience; it could build a temple, but not deliver permanent access. The Messiah’s arrival means the root system is being
judged and replaced.
</p>

<h3>4) “Holy Spirit and Fire”: One Messiah, Two Outcomes in the Transition</h3>
<p>
John’s language is deliberately double-edged: “He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.” This is not two different comings, or a
two-millennia gap. It is one covenant transition with two outcomes. The Spirit is the life of the New Covenant—God’s presence written into
people, not stone. Fire is the consuming removal of what resists that covenant reality.
</p>
<p>
The “winnowing shovel” explains it. The Messiah cleanses His threshing floor: wheat is gathered; chaff is burned. This is covenant separation
within Israel during the last days of the Mosaic age (AD 30–70). The remnant who received Messiah were gathered into the New Covenant
storehouse. The chaff of hardened resistance met the covenant consequences that culminated historically in Jerusalem’s fall. The fire is
therefore covenant fire: burning away the obsolete order so the New Creation stands without rival.
</p>

<h3>5) The Baptism of Jesus: Public Identification of the Beloved Son</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ baptism is not confession of personal sin; it is covenant identification. He steps into Israel’s story as the faithful representative.
“Fulfill all righteousness” means He assumes the covenant role Israel failed to fulfill, and He will carry it through to completion. Then the
heavens open, the Spirit descends, and the Father declares: “This is My Son—the Beloved.”
</p>
<p>
That declaration is coronation and identity. Israel was called God’s son in the Exodus story, but proved unfaithful. Jesus is the true Son,
true Israel, the faithful one through whom covenant righteousness is established. The Spirit’s descent signals new creation beginnings: God is
forming a new humanity in and through the Son. From this point forward, Matthew will show the collision between the Beloved Son and the old
order that cannot survive His presence.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You are not living under “coming wrath” as a future dread. The old covenant administration that accused and measured has been judged and
removed, and you live from the gift John pointed toward: the baptism of the Holy Spirit—God’s indwelling life. The Father’s delight in the
Beloved Son is not distant; in Christ, it is the settled atmosphere of your identity now.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where are you still bracing like the axe is aimed at you, instead of resting as gathered “wheat” in the Beloved Son—already safe, already
accepted, already inside the Kingdom?
