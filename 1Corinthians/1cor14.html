<h1>1 Corinthians 14</h1>
<h2>Intelligibility, Order, and Shared Building</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul applies love to gathered worship.
Speech that cannot be understood
may express devotion,
but it does not build others.
Edification, not experience,
guides the use of gifts.
</p>

<p>
Prophetic speech is valued
because it strengthens, encourages, and consoles.
Uninterpreted tongues benefit the speaker,
but interpreted speech benefits the body.
Love seeks the latter.
</p>

<p>
Paul insists on intelligibility.
Sound without meaning produces confusion.
Worship shaped by the Spirit
reflects clarity and peace,
not chaos.
</p>

<p>
Order is not control;
it is care.
Multiple contributions are welcome,
but they must serve understanding.
God’s character is expressed
through peaceable participation.
</p>

<p>
Paul concludes that everything in the assembly
should be done for building up.
Gifts are exercised freely,
yet governed by love and mutual regard.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Following the love chapter,
Paul corrects gift misuse.
The issue is not suppression,
but orientation toward shared life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Love governs expression</h3>
<p>
Spiritual expression is evaluated
by its effect on others.
Private devotion and public edification
are not the same thing.
</p>

<h3>2) Prophecy serves formation</h3>
<p>
Prophetic speech strengthens the community.
Its value lies in clarity,
not spectacle.
</p>

<h3>3) Order reflects God’s nature</h3>
<p>
Peace is not the absence of activity,
but the presence of coherence.
God’s Spirit does not compete with Himself.
</p>

<h3>4) Authority is communal, not individual</h3>
<p>
Paul invites discernment.
No single voice dominates.
The body listens, weighs, and responds together.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nehemiah 8 — understanding the word</li>
  <li>Acts 2 — intelligible proclamation</li>
  <li>Ephesians 4 — building up the body</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Worship is not performance.
It is participation.
The Spirit speaks to build people,
not to elevate moments.
Clarity serves love.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Does what I bring into shared space
help others understand, grow, and belong?
</p>
