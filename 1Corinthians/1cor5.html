<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Public Sin and Arrogance Exposed (5:1–2)</h3>

<p>
It is actually being reported that sexual immorality exists among you —
of a kind not even tolerated among the nations:
a man is living with his father’s wife.
</p>

<p>
And instead of grieving,
you have become arrogant.
You should already have removed the one who committed this act from among you.
</p>

<h3>Paul’s Present Judgment (5:3–5)</h3>

<p>
Even though I am absent in body,
I am present with you in spirit.
And as one present,
I have already pronounced judgment on the one who has done this.
</p>

<p>
When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus,
with His power present,
deliver such a person over to the realm of destruction —
so that the flesh is undone,
and the spirit is rescued within the day of the Lord.
</p>

<h3>Leaven Corrupts the Whole Community (5:6–8)</h3>

<p>
Your boasting is not good.
Do you not know that a little leaven permeates the whole batch?
</p>

<p>
You have already been cleansed.
So remove the old leaven,
so you may live as what you already are —
an unleavened people.
For Christ, our Passover, has already been sacrificed.
</p>

<p>
So let us keep the feast —
not with the old leaven of malice and wickedness,
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
</p>

<h3>Clarifying Separation (5:9–13)</h3>

<p>
I wrote to you not to associate with sexually immoral people —
not meaning the immoral of the world,
or the greedy, the dishonest, or idolaters,
since you would then have to leave the world entirely.
</p>

<p>
But now I am writing to clarify:
do not associate with anyone who claims the name “brother”
yet lives in unrepentant sexual immorality,
greed,
idolatry,
abusive speech,
drunkenness,
or exploitation.
Do not even share a meal with such a person.
</p>

<p>
What do I have to do with judging outsiders?
Is it not those inside the community that you are already responsible for?
</p>

<p>
God addresses those outside.
You are to remove the corrupting influence from among yourselves.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Corinth prides itself on spiritual gifts and freedom,
but tolerates behaviour that actively destroys the community.
Paul does not treat this as private morality —
he treats it as **temple corruption**.
Chapter 3 declared the church to be God’s temple.
Chapter 5 explains what happens when that temple is polluted.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Judgment” here is covenant discipline, not afterlife sentencing</h3>
<p>
Paul does not postpone judgment to the future.
He says he has already judged the situation (5:3),
and instructs the church to act decisively.
This is covenant order being protected in real time,
not speculation about final destinies.
</p>

<h3>2) “Deliver to Satan” describes removal from covenant protection</h3>
<p>
This phrase does not mean demonic torture.
It describes exclusion from the Spirit-ordered community
into the realm where destructive fleshly patterns dominate.
The aim is restoration, not annihilation.
</p>

<h3>3) Passover language is already fulfilled</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say Christ <em>will be</em> sacrificed.
He says Christ <em>has been</em> sacrificed (5:7).
The community is already living in post-Passover reality.
Old leaven has no legitimate place.
</p>

<h3>4) Separation is internal, not escapist</h3>
<p>
Paul explicitly rejects withdrawing from society.
The boundary applies only to those claiming covenant identity
while refusing covenant transformation.
</p>

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Leaven” (5:6–8):</strong> corrupting influence that spreads if tolerated.</li>
  <li><strong>“Unleavened” (5:7):</strong> covenant status already true because of Christ.</li>
  <li><strong>“Day of the Lord” (5:5):</strong> covenant evaluation context, not a distant apocalypse.</li>
  <li><strong>“Judge” (5:3,12):</strong> communal responsibility, not personal condemnation.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Grace does not mean ignoring destruction.
Love does not mean tolerating what poisons community life.
New Creation holiness is not moral panic —
it is the protection of shared life, truth, and freedom.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where have I confused tolerance with love,
or avoided responsibility in the name of grace?
</p>
