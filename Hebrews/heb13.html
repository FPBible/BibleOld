<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 13 — Living From a Finished Covenant</h2>

<h3>Love Is Assumed, Not Commanded Into Existence</h3>

<p>
Let brotherly love continue.
Do not neglect hospitality,
because through it some have welcomed messengers without realising it.
Remember those in prison,
as if you were imprisoned with them,
and those who are mistreated,
since you yourselves live in the body
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:1–3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews does not introduce love as a new requirement.
It assumes love as the normal expression of life
inside the settled covenant reality.
</p>

<h3>Security Replaces Grasping</h3>

<p>
Let marriage be honoured by all,
and let the marriage bed remain undefiled.
God will judge sexual immorality and adultery.
Keep your life free from the love of money,
and be content with what you have,
for He has said,
“I will never leave you nor abandon you”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/DEU31.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Deut 31:6)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:4–5)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Contentment flows from covenant security.
Once abandonment is removed,
fear loses its leverage.
</p>

<h3>Confidence Is the New Covenant Posture</h3>

<p>
So we confidently say,
“The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
What can people do to me?”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA118.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Ps 118:6)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is not bravado.
It is the natural result of permanent divine nearness.
</p>

<h3>Leadership Points Back to Christ, Not to Itself</h3>

<p>
Remember your leaders
who spoke the word of God to you.
Consider the outcome of their way of life
and imitate their faith
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:7)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The unchanging Christ stabilises the community
during covenant transition.
The message does not shift,
even as the old system collapses.
</p>

<h3>Grace Governs the Heart, Not Ritual</h3>

<p>
Do not be carried away by various and strange teachings.
It is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace,
not by foods,
which have never benefited those devoted to them
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:9)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Food laws and ritual observance
belong to a covenant that no longer governs.
Grace now defines identity from within.
</p>

<h3>Outside the Camp Is Covenant Separation</h3>

<p>
We have an altar
from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.
The bodies of animals whose blood is brought into the holy places
are burned outside the camp.
So Jesus also suffered outside the gate
to make the people holy through His own blood
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:10–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
“Outside the camp” is covenant language.
It marks separation from an obsolete system,
not withdrawal from society.
</p>

<h3>The Lasting City Already Defines Belonging</h3>

<p>
Therefore let us go to Him outside the camp,
bearing the reproach He endured.
For here we do not have a lasting city,
but we seek the one that is coming
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:13–14)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews has already identified this city:
Mount Zion,
the heavenly Jerusalem,
already accessed (Heb 12:22).
The “coming” language reflects transition,
not delay.
</p>

<h3>Worship Is Lived, Not Offered</h3>

<p>
Through Him, then,
let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God —
the fruit of lips that confess His name.
Do not neglect doing good and sharing,
for God is pleased with such sacrifices
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:15–16)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sacrifice has fully migrated
from altar to life.
</p>

<h3>Authority Exists to Guard Life</h3>

<p>
Obey your leaders and submit to them,
because they keep watch over your lives
as those who will give an account.
Let them do this with joy, not grief,
for that would be of no benefit to you
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:17)</a>.
</p>

<p>
New-covenant leadership protects people,
not systems.
</p>

<h3>Prayer Assumes Clear Conscience</h3>

<p>
Pray for us,
for we are confident that we have a clear conscience,
desiring to act honourably in all things
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB13.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 13:18)</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Benediction Assumes Completion</h3>

<p>
Now may the God of peace —
who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep
through the blood of the eternal covenant,
our Lord Jesus —
equip you with everything good
to do His will,
working in us what is pleasing in His sight,
through Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory forever
