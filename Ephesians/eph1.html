<h1>Ephesians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1 — Chosen, Seated, and Sealed in Christ</h2>

<p><em>
Ephesians 1 was written during the final years of the Old Covenant world,
addressing believers living through the transition into the fully established
New Creation.
</em></p>

<h3>Blessed in Christ</h3>

<p>
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:2–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
In Him, God chose us before the foundation of the world —
not to create religious performers,
but to make a holy people, set apart in love.
He marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ,
according to the good pleasure of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace,
which He freely gave us in the Beloved.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:4–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Redemption and Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
In Him we have redemption through His blood —
the release, the rescue, the end of condemnation —
the forgiveness of trespasses,
according to the riches of His grace
which He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:7–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Mystery Revealed</h3>

<p>
He made known to us the mystery of His will,
according to His good pleasure which He set forth in Christ:
to bring everything into unity under one Head — Christ —
in the fullness of the times,
things in heaven and things on earth.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:9–10)</a>
</p>

<p>
In Him we were given an inheritance,
having been marked out beforehand according to His purpose,
who works all things according to the counsel of His will,
so that we — who first hoped in Christ —
might exist to the praise of His glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:11–12)</a>
</p>

<h3>Sealed by the Spirit</h3>

<p>
In Him, when you heard the message of truth —
the good news of your rescue — and trusted it,
you were marked out as God’s own by the promised Holy Spirit.
The Spirit was the covenant sign and assurance that you fully belonged to God’s people,
guaranteeing your share in the inheritance during the passing of the old order,
until God’s redeemed people were publicly established —
resulting in the praise of His glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:13–14)</a>

<strong>Clarification — “Until the Redemption”</strong><br />
Paul is not pointing to an unfinished future event.
The “seal” and “guarantee” language belongs to the covenant-transition period
between Christ’s work and the full removal of the old temple order.
Once that transition was complete, God’s people were no longer “awaiting” redemption —
they were fully constituted as the New Creation.
<br /><br />
The Spirit is not a pledge of something still coming,
but the settled reality of life in Christ.
</div>

<h3>Paul’s Prayer: Eyes Opened to Reality</h3>

<p>
Because of this, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
and your love toward all the saints,
I do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers:
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,
having the eyes of your heart enlightened,
so that you may know the hope of His calling,
the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,
and the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:15–19)</a>
</p>

<h3>Enthroned Christ, Seated People</h3>

<p>
This is the power He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead
and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realm,
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,
and above every name that is named —
not only in this age but also in the age to come.
He put all things under His feet
and gave Him as Head over all things to the church,
which is His body,
the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:20–23)</a>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 1</h2>

<h3>1) “Before the foundation of the world” is not fatalism — it’s covenant intent</h3>
<p>
Paul is not turning salvation into a lottery.
He is stating that God’s plan to create a holy family in Christ
was set before the old world ran its course.
Election is identity: God’s people defined in the Beloved, not in Sinai.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:4–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Redemption is not “later” — it is release into a new standing</h3>
<p>
Redemption here is deliverance from condemnation and separation.
It is forgiveness that creates access.
This is why Paul speaks in the present tense: “we have redemption.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:7)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “Fullness of the times” is covenant culmination, not end-of-universe suspense</h3>
<p>
Paul’s “fullness” points to the moment when God’s plan reached its appointed maturity:
everything being gathered under one Head.
That is covenant administration changing hands — to Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:9–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) The Spirit’s seal is assurance, not suspense</h3>
<p>
The Spirit marks belonging.
During the transition out of the old temple order,
the Spirit was the public covenant sign that Gentile and Jew alike belonged to the inheritance.
After that transition, the Spirit remains the settled reality of life in Christ —
not a dangling promise of “not yet.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:13–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Enthronement means the powers are not ultimate</h3>
<p>
Paul places Christ above every authority — religious, political, and spiritual.
This is not poetry; it is worldview correction.
If Christ is seated, the church is not begging for a kingdom —
it embodies His reign as His body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm">(Eph 1:20–23)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 1 reads like a constitution because it is one:
identity in Christ, redemption accomplished, the mystery revealed,
and a people sealed into the New Creation under an enthroned King.
