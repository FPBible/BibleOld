<div class="scripture-text">
So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.<br/>
The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.<br/>
They kept saying, â€œHail, King of the Jews!â€ and they kept slapping him.<br/>
Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, â€œBehold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.â€<br/>
Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, â€œBehold, the man!â€<br/>
When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, â€œCrucify! Crucify!â€<br/>
Pilate said to them, â€œTake him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.â€<br/>
The Jews answered him, â€œWe have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.â€<br/>
When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.<br/>
He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, â€œWhere are you from?â€ But Jesus gave him no answer.<br/>
Pilate therefore said to him, â€œArenâ€™t you speaking to me? Donâ€™t you know that I have power to release you and have power to crucify you?â€<br/>
Jesus answered, â€œYou would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.â€<br/>
At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, â€œIf you release this man, you arenâ€™t Caesarâ€™s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!â€<br/>
When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called â€œThe Pavementâ€, but in Hebrew, â€œGabbatha.â€<br/>
Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, â€œBehold, your King!â€<br/>
They cried out, â€œAway with him! Away with him! Crucify him!â€<br/>
Pilate said to them, â€œShall I crucify your King?â€<br/>
The chief priests answered, â€œWe have no king but Caesar!â€<br/>
So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.<br/>
He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called â€œThe Place of a Skullâ€, which is called in Hebrew, â€œGolgothaâ€,<br/>
where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.<br/>
Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, â€œJESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.â€<br/>
Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.<br/>
The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, â€œDonâ€™t write, â€˜The King of the Jews,â€™ but, â€˜he said, â€œI am King of the Jews.â€Â â€™Â â€<br/>
Pilate answered, â€œWhat I have written, I have written.â€<br/>
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<br/>
Then they said to one another, â€œLetâ€™s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,â€ that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,<br/>
â€œThey parted my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots.â€<br/>
Therefore the soldiers did these things.<br/>
But standing by Jesusâ€™ cross were his mother, his motherâ€™s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<br/>
Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, â€œWoman, behold, your son!â€<br/>
Then he said to the disciple, â€œBehold, your mother!â€ From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.<br/>
After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, â€œI am thirsty.â€<br/>
Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.<br/>
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, â€œIt is finished.â€ He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.<br/>
Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldnâ€™t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.<br/>
Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;<br/>
but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didnâ€™t break his legs.<br/>
However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.<br/>
He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.<br/>
For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, â€œA bone of him will not be broken.â€<br/>
Again another Scripture says, â€œThey will look on him whom they pierced.â€<br/>
After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesusâ€™ body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.<br/>
Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.<br/>
So they took Jesusâ€™ body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.<br/>
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.<br/>
Then because of the Jewsâ€™ Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, largely silent before accusers</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Roman authority, temple leadership, and Israel</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The decisive judgment and completion of the old covenant world through the cross</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Israel publicly rejects its Messiah and declares allegiance to Caesar, sealing the fate of the old order.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>
<h3>1) â€œWe have no king but Caesarâ€ ends the old covenant</h3>
<p>This declaration is the climax of covenant rebellion. Israel renounces Godâ€™s kingship and transfers loyalty to Rome.</p>
<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>Temple-centered authority, sacrificial mediation, and national covenant identity.</p>
<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>A kingdom established through the cross, a people formed by Spirit, and access to God opened through the Son.</p>
<h3>4) The cross is enthronement</h3>
<p>John presents the crucifixion as the moment Jesus is revealed as King. His title is proclaimed in multiple languages.</p>
<h3>5) â€œIt is finishedâ€ means completed</h3>
<p>The work of the old covenant is brought to completion. Nothing remains unfinished, delayed, or pending.</p>
<h3>6) Blood and water</h3>
<p>This imagery signals cleansing and life flowing from the crucified Christ â€” New Covenant reality replacing temple rituals.</p>
<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The cross initiates the irreversible judgment of the old order, culminating in Jerusalemâ€™s fall in AD 70.</p>
