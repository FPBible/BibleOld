<h1>Matthew 9</h1>
<h2>New Wine, New Wineskins, and the Authority to Forgive</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/englsv/MAT09.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 9 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
In Matthew 9, the friction between the New Covenant and the Old reaches a boiling point. 
Jesus asserts His authority over sin, social outcasts, and religious traditions, 
eventually declaring that the "Old Wineskin" can no longer contain what God is doing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Authority on Earth to Forgive (9:1–8)</h3>
<p>
Jesus told a paralyzed man, "Your sins have been forgiven you." 
When the scribes accused Him of blasphemy, Jesus challenged them: 
"Which is easier? To say 'forgiven' or 'walk'?" 
To prove the New Covenant authority has established forgiveness on earth, 
He healed the man. The crowd marveled that such authority was now given to men.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The transition from the Temple (where blood was required repeatedly) to the Son of Man (where forgiveness is a finished declaration) has occurred.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Mercy over Sacrifice (9:9–13)</h3>
<p>
Jesus called Matthew, a tax collector, and ate with outcasts. 
When the Pharisees complained, He told them: 
"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. I did not come to call the 'righteous' of the old system, 
but to call 'sinners' into a new reality."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "Sacrifice" system of the Law is being superseded by the "Mercy" of the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The New Wineskin (9:14–17)</h3>
<p>
When asked about fasting, Jesus said you cannot mourn while the Bridegroom is present. 
He warned: "You don't put a new patch on an old garment, nor New Wine into old wineskins. 
If you do, both are ruined. The New Wine needs a New Wineskin."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> You cannot mix Law and Grace. The Old Covenant structure cannot contain the Spirit of the New.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Life swallowing up the Curse (9:18–26)</h3>
<p>
A woman who was "unclean" for twelve years touched His garment and was healed. 
Then, Jesus entered the home of a dead girl, told the mourners she was only sleeping, and raised her up.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "curse" of the Law (blood and death) is being swallowed up by the Life of the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Harvest of the New Age (9:27–38)</h3>
<p>
Jesus gave sight to the blind and voice to the mute. 
Seeing the crowds, He felt compassion because they were "harassed" by the heavy burdens of the Old Law. 
"The harvest is great," He said, "but the workers are few."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "harvest" is the gathering of people out of the collapsing Old World and into the rest of the New.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Forgiveness is an "on-earth" reality</h3>
<p>
Jesus demonstrates that forgiveness is no longer tied to a building (the Temple) or a ceremony. 
It is a word of authority spoken into the human condition. 
In the Finished Work, forgiveness is our baseline.
</p>

<h3>2) The death of the "Patching" mentality</h3>
<p>
Many try to "patch" their lives with bits of Jesus while staying in the old garment of legalism. 
Jesus forbids this. The New Wine of the Spirit demands a total departure from the old system.
</p>

<h3>3) The harvest is the exit from the Law</h3>
<p>
The "harassed and helpless" sheep were those being beaten down by the Pharisaical system. 
The "harvest" was the liberation of these people into the finished reality of Christ.
</p>
