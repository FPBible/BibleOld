      <h2>The Crisis of Modern Reading</h2>
      <p>
        When modern readers see the phrase "heaven and earth" in the Bible, they immediately think like scientists. We picture the physical globe (Earth) and the atmospheric or astronomical space above it (Heaven). Therefore, when Peter speaks of the "heavens passing away with a great noise, and the elements melting with fervent heat" (2 Peter 3:10), we naturally assume he is describing a future, global, thermo-nuclear destruction of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the ancient Hebrews did not think like modern scientists; they thought like priests and covenant theologians. In biblical prophecy, <strong>"heaven and earth" is a standard idiom for a covenantal order, specifically the Mosaic Covenant and the Temple system.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing to understand this idiom causes readers to wait for the physical destruction of the planet, missing the glorious truth that the "New Heavens and New Earth" is the spiritual reality we already inhabit in Christ.

      <h2>Planting the Heavens at Sinai</h2>
      <p>
        To prove that "heaven and earth" refers to the covenant, we must look at how God describes the creation of the nation of Israel. Look at God’s words to Israel in Isaiah 51:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion, ‘You are my people.’" (Isaiah 51:16)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        When did God put His words in their mouth and declare Zion to be His people? At Mount Sinai, when He gave them the Law and established the Old Covenant. Isaiah equates the <strong>giving of the Old Covenant</strong> with <strong>planting the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth.</strong> God "created a world" when He formed Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses understood this perfectly. When he called witnesses to testify against Israel regarding the covenant, he didn't call neighboring nations. He said: <em>"Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth"</em> (Deut 32:1). He was addressing the covenant people and the order they lived under.
      </p>

      <h2>The Temple as a Microcosm</h2>
      
      <p>
        This covenantal "world" was physically modeled in the Jewish Temple. The first-century Jewish historian Josephus, and the philosopher Philo, both explicitly wrote that the Temple was designed as a miniature universe (a microcosm). 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Heavens:</strong> The Holy of Holies, where God's presence dwelt, represented the heavens.</li>
        <li><strong>The Earth:</strong> The outer courtyards and the Holy Place represented the earth and the sea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a first-century Jew, the Temple <em>was</em> heaven and earth. As long as the Temple stood, their "world" remained intact. If the Temple fell, their "heaven and earth" collapsed.
      </p>

      <h2>Jesus and the Passing of the Law</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding this idiom unlocks one of the most confusing statements Jesus ever made. In Matthew 5:18, Jesus says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If "heaven and earth" means the physical planet, we have a massive theological problem. If the physical planet is still here, then <strong>not one pen stroke has passed from the Law of Moses.</strong> We should still be sacrificing animals, stoning Sabbath-breakers, and avoiding pork. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But if "heaven and earth" was the Jewish idiom for the Old Covenant system and the Temple, Jesus' meaning is perfectly clear: <em>The Mosaic Law remains binding upon Israel until the Old Covenant system (the Temple) is completely destroyed.</em> In AD 70, the Roman army burned the Temple to the ground. That Old Covenant "heaven and earth" passed away, and the Law vanished with it (Hebrews 8:13).

      <h2>The Shaking of Heaven and Earth</h2>
      <p>
        The writer of Hebrews confirms this interpretation. In Hebrews 12:26-28, writing just years before the destruction of Jerusalem, he quotes Haggai:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "He has promised, saying, 'Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.' This phrase, 'Yet once more,' signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        What was being shaken and removed? Not the literal solar system. The author is contrasting Mount Sinai (the Old Covenant, v. 18-21) with Mount Zion (the New Covenant, v. 22-24). The Old Covenant "heaven and earth" was being shaken and removed so that the unshakable New Covenant kingdom could remain permanently.

      <h2>The New Heavens and New Earth</h2>
      <p>
        When John sees "a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away" (Revelation 21:1), he is witnessing the transition of covenants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "first heaven and earth" was the Jerusalem-based, Temple-centric, Mosaic system. It passed away in the fire of AD 70. The "New Heaven and New Earth" is the New Covenant order—the global, Spirit-filled church, the bride of Christ, the true Tabernacle where God dwells with humanity (Rev 21:3). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah prophesied this exact covenant shift: <em>"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy"</em> (Isaiah 65:17-18).

      <h2>What This Is NOT Saying</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This idiom is <strong>not</strong> saying that the physical planet will one day be destroyed by God in a global catastrophe. </li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> saying that believers will eventually be evacuated to a different physical planet.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> teaching that we are waiting for a future geological "re-creation" of the globe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>God declared in Ecclesiastes 1:4 and Psalm 104:5 that the physical earth abides forever. What passes away are <em>covenants</em> and <em>empires</em>, not planetary bodies.</p>

      <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
      <p>
        You are not waiting for the world to end. You are living in the New Heavens and the New Earth right now. The old system of debt, animal blood, geographical borders, and condemnation went up in smoke in the first century. Christ established a New Covenant world where righteousness dwells (2 Peter 3:13). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You are reading covenant history for assurance, not headlines for doom.</strong> God is not planning to burn up your planet; He has already burned up the dividing wall of hostility. You are currently a citizen of the New Jerusalem, called to bring the healing water of the Gospel to the nations (Rev 22:2).
