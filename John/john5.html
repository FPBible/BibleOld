<div class="scripture-text">
<p>After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches.</p>
<p>
In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;</p>
<p>
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.</p>
<p>
A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.</p>
<p>
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?”</p>
<p>
The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”</p>
<p>
Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”</p>
<p>
Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.</p>
<p>
Now it was the Sabbath on that day.</p>
<p>
So the Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”</p>
<p>
He answered them, “He who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”</p>
<p>
Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your mat and walk’?”</p>
<p>
But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.</p>
<p>
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, “Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”</p>
<p>
The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</p>
<p>
For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>
But Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, so I am working, too.”</p>
<p>
For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
<p>
Jesus therefore answered them, “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.</p>
<p>
For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</p>
<p>
For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.</p>
<p>
For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</p>
<p>
that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.</p>
<p>
“Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</p>
<p>
Most certainly I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live.</p>
<p>
For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.</p>
<p>
He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.</p>
<p>
Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice,</p>
<p>
and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</p>
<p>
I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.</p>
<p>
“If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.</p>
<p>
It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.</p>
<p>
You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</p>
<p>
But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.</p>
<p>
He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</p>
<p>
But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.</p>
<p>
The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</p>
<p>
You don’t have his word living in you, because you don’t believe him whom he sent.</p>
<p>
“You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.</p>
<p>
Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.</p>
<p>
I don’t receive glory from men.</p>
<p>
But I know you, that you don’t have God’s love in yourselves.</p>
<p>
I have come in my Father’s name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</p>
<p>
How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?</p>
<p>
“Don’t think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</p>
<p>
For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.</p>
<p>
But if you don’t believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”</p>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus is speaking inside the temple world — the covenant system centered in Jerusalem.
He heals on the Sabbath and then claims divine authority: “My Father is working… and I am working.”
That statement is not a side comment. It is a direct collision with the authority structure of the old order.
</p>
<p>
The audience is the leadership class — the religious system guarding Sabbath boundaries, temple status, and legal identity.
John 5 is not primarily a morality story about kindness. It is a covenant confrontation:
the old world cannot heal, and it cannot tolerate the One who can.
</p>
<p>
This is why resurrection and judgment language appears here.
Jesus is announcing a transition of life and authority.
In John’s Gospel, these are not distant topics — they are present realities tied to Jesus’ mission
and the approaching covenant crisis.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Prophecy Commentary</h2>
<h3>1) Bethesda is a picture of the system that cannot heal</h3>
<p>
The man is trapped in a ritual environment, waiting for a moment he can never reach in time.
The story is a living parable: the old covenant world surrounds the broken,
but cannot restore them. Jesus does not improve the system. He bypasses it.
Life comes from the Son, not from the machinery of religion.
</p>
<h3>2) Thirty-eight years signals wilderness paralysis</h3>
<p>
“Thirty-eight years” echoes Israel’s long wilderness delay (Deut 2:14).
It points to a people stuck in transition: delivered, yet not free; near promise, yet not entering rest.
John is showing more than a healing — he is showing a covenant condition.
</p>
<h3>3) Sabbath conflict reveals the end of old rest</h3>
<p>
By healing on the Sabbath, Jesus is not “breaking God’s law” — He is exposing how the system has turned the sign of rest into control.
Sabbath was meant to point to God’s rest and completion.
Jesus heals on that day to declare that true rest is arriving in Him,
and that the old rest-marker is about to be surpassed by living access.
</p>
<h3>4) “The dead will hear My voice” is resurrection-in-history language</h3>
<p>
Jesus says the hour is coming — and now is — when the dead will hear and live (Jn 5:25).
That is not “thousands of years later.”
This is prophetic language describing awakening: covenant death giving way to covenant life.
Like Ezekiel’s valley of dry bones, it is restoration language for a people under death and condemnation,
being called into life by the word of God.
</p>
<h3>5) Two "Hours" in John 5 — Two Different Resurrections</h3>
<p>Jesus speaks of "the hour" twice in this chapter, but with a critical distinction that reveals the timing of resurrection and judgment.</p>
<p><strong>First Hour (v. 25): "The hour is coming, and now is"</strong><br/>
This is spiritual resurrection — the dead hearing the voice of the Son and receiving life. Jesus says this hour is already present during His ministry. It's the covenant transition happening in real-time: people moving from death under the Law to life in the Spirit. This is the new birth, the regeneration of Israel (Ezek 36-37), the valley of dry bones coming to life.</p>
<p><strong>Second Hour (v. 28-29): "The hour is coming"</strong><br/>
Notice the difference: Jesus does NOT say "and now is." This hour is still future from His perspective. This is the bodily resurrection and the public judgment that will occur when "all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out — those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."</p>
<p>This language directly echoes Daniel 12:2 — "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." That prophecy was not about a distant end of the world. It was about the resurrection-judgment that would come upon Israel when "the power of the holy people" was "completely shattered" (Dan 12:7) — which happened at the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.</p>
<p>So John 5 describes two resurrections:<br/>
1. Spiritual resurrection (ongoing during Jesus' ministry through the cross)<br/>
2. Covenant resurrection-judgment (completed at AD 70)</p>
<p>Both are historical, first-century realities. Neither awaits a distant future. The hour that "is coming, and now is" describes the present transition. The hour that "is coming" (without "now is") describes the completion of that transition — which Jesus placed within the lifetime of His hearers (Matt 24:34).</p>
<h3>6) Judgment is delegated and time-bound</h3>
<p>
Jesus ties judgment to His identity as the “Son of Man” (Jn 5:27).
That phrase carries Daniel 7:13–14: authority given to the Son of Man to rule and judge.
In John, judgment is not postponed indefinitely.
It is active, unfolding, and climaxes in the covenant judgment that ends the old temple order.
</p>
<h3>7) “Tombs” and “coming out” fit Israel’s prophetic vocabulary</h3>
<p>
Israel’s Scriptures regularly describe covenant exile and condemnation as “death,” “graves,” and “tombs.”
To “come out” is to be restored into life, identity, and covenant standing.
John 5 uses that same vocabulary: Jesus is calling people out of the death-world of the Law
into the life-world of the Son.
</p>
<h3>8) Eternal life is a present possession, not a delayed reward</h3>
<p>
John 5:24 is decisive: the believer <em>has</em> eternal life and <em>does not come</em> into condemnation.
This is New Creation reality: life is not a future prize; it is a present transfer —
out of death into life.
</p>

<h2>Key Idioms &amp; Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Hour is coming — and now is”</strong> — imminent transition language. John uses “hour” to mark covenant turning points, not vague futurism.</li>
<li><strong>“Resurrection”</strong> — prophetic restoration language (life out of death), applied to the covenant death-world being replaced.</li>
<li><strong>“Judgment”</strong> — historical vindication and removal of the old condemned order, delegated to the Son of Man (Dan 7).</li>
<li><strong>“Tombs”</strong> — exile/death imagery from Israel’s prophets, not a requirement to read the passage as modern biological categories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
John 5 refuses “delayed life.”
The Son is not offering a future upgrade; He is transferring people now.
If you are in Christ, you are not waiting to become alive.
You have crossed over.
Condemnation is not your atmosphere.
Life is.
</p>
<p>
This also reshapes how you read “judgment.”
For the believer, judgment is not a looming threat — it is a settled verdict:
life has won, access is open, and the old accusing system has no final claim.
The Son’s voice still calls people out of death-patterns into lived freedom.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I still waiting beside a “pool” — treating life as something I might earn or reach —
instead of receiving the Son’s word as present transfer from death into life?
