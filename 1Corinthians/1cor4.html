<h2>Stewards, Not Stars · Stop Premature Verdicts</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>Stewards Under the Lord’s Evaluation (4:1–5)</h3>

<p>
This is how you should think of us: servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries.
What is required of a steward is faithfulness.
</p>

<p>
As for being evaluated by you, or by any human court, that does not control me.
I do not even appoint myself as the final judge.
My conscience is not my courtroom.
The Lord is the One who evaluates me.
</p>

<p>
So stop issuing final verdicts before the Lord’s time.
Do not run ahead of Him.
He is already bringing hidden things into the light,
and He is already exposing motives.
Then each person receives whatever praise is truly fitting from God.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Don’t Go Beyond What Is Written (4:6–8)</h3>

<p>
I’ve applied these things to myself and Apollos for your sake,
so you learn not to go beyond what is written,
so that none of you becomes proud,
taking sides against another.
</p>

<p>
Who makes you superior?
What do you have that you did not receive?
And if you received it, why boast as if you produced it?
</p>

<p>
You are acting satisfied already.
Rich already.
Ruling already.
You are talking like you’ve reached the finish line
and the kingdom is your trophy.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Apostolic Reality vs Corinthian Pride (4:9–13)</h3>

<p>
God has displayed the apostles as last in line —
like people sentenced —
made a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to humanity.
</p>

<p>
We are treated like fools for Christ,
but you want to be wise in Christ.
We are weak,
but you want to look strong.
You crave honour,
but we are treated with contempt.
</p>

<p>
Up to this moment we have gone hungry and thirsty,
we are poorly clothed,
we are treated harshly,
and we have no stable place.
We labour, working with our own hands.
</p>

<p>
When we are insulted, we bless.
When persecuted, we endure.
When slandered, we answer gently.
We have been treated like the world’s refuse,
the scum of all things.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>A Father’s Warning and Real Authority (4:14–21)</h3>

<p>
I am not writing these things to shame you,
but to warn you as my beloved children.
You may have countless instructors in Christ,
but you do not have many fathers.
I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
</p>

<p>
So imitate me —
not my personality,
but my Christ-shaped pattern.
This is why I am sending Timothy to you.
He will remind you of my ways in Christ,
as I teach everywhere in every church.
</p>

<p>
Some of you have become arrogant,
as though I am not coming.
But I am coming soon, if the Lord permits,
and I will find out what is real —
not the talk of the arrogant, but their power.
</p>

<p>
For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power.
So what do you want?
Shall I come with firmness,
or with love and a gentle spirit?
</p>

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Corinth is treating apostles like competing brands and using “wisdom” as a status system.
Paul has already dismantled this in chapters 1–3.
Now he strikes the root:
<strong>pride + premature judgment + personality worship</strong>.
The gospel creates stewards and servants, not celebrities and factions.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Judge nothing before the time” is a correction of arrogance, not a ban on discernment</h3>
<p>
Paul is not saying, “Never evaluate anything.”
He is saying, “Stop acting like you hold the final court.”
Corinth is issuing verdicts on apostles while ignoring their own jealousy and strife.
The Lord’s evaluation exposes motives, not just appearances.
</p>

<h3>2) The Lord’s “coming” language here is pastoral, not end-times forecasting</h3>
<p>
When Paul says he is “coming soon” (4:19), it is a near-term visit.
And when he speaks of the Lord’s timing (4:5), it is present divine evaluation,
not a distant apocalypse.
This chapter is about accountability in the community right now.
</p>

<h3>3) Kingdom “power” is not hype — it is lived transformation</h3>
<p>
“The kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power” (4:20) does not mean loud religion.
It means reality: humility replacing pride, love replacing rivalry, service replacing status.
Power is what remains when applause is removed.
</p>

<h3>4) Fatherhood is responsibility, not control</h3>
<p>
Paul calls himself a father because he birthed them through the gospel (4:15).
He is not demanding worship; he is calling them to maturity.
His firmness is directed at arrogance that destroys community.
</p>

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Stewards of mysteries” (4:1):</strong> faithful servants handling the revealed gospel, not secret knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>“Beyond what is written” (4:6):</strong> stop inventing standards and boasting systems; stay inside the gospel’s measuring line.</li>
  <li><strong>“Power” (4:20):</strong> Spirit-produced reality in community life, not rhetorical dominance.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
This chapter destroys the “Christian influencer” mindset.
New Creation life is not built by clout, cleverness, or factional loyalty.
It is built by faithfulness, humility, endurance, and love.
If we need a platform to feel significant, we are still living in the old identity system.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I tempted to measure people (or myself) by image, talk, and status —
instead of faithfulness and love?
</p>
