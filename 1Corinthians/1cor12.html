<h1>1 Corinthians 12</h1>
<h2>Diversity of Gifts · Unity of Life</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul turns to spiritual gifts to restore clarity and unity.
No gift originates in human effort.
Every manifestation comes from the same Spirit,
expressed in diverse ways for the good of all.
</p>

<p>
Confessing “Jesus is Lord” is not a slogan
but a Spirit-formed allegiance.
The Spirit never competes with Christ;
He reveals and exalts Him.
</p>

<p>
Paul names varieties of gifts, services, and workings,
yet insists the source is one God.
Gifts are not status markers.
They are functions of shared life.
</p>

<p>
He then frames the community as a body.
No part stands alone.
No role is unnecessary.
Weakness is not exclusion; it is essential.
Honour flows toward what seems least impressive.
</p>

<p>
God arranges the body intentionally,
so division has no ground.
Suffering and rejoicing are shared,
because life is shared.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The Corinthians are ranking gifts
and measuring spirituality by visibility.
Paul dismantles this by re-centering gifts
within the unity of the body.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Gifts reveal the Spirit’s generosity</h3>
<p>
Gifts are manifestations, not possessions.
They appear where needed
and serve the whole body.
Ownership thinking fractures unity.
</p>

<h3>2) Confession defines allegiance</h3>
<p>
Calling Jesus “Lord” marks covenant loyalty.
The Spirit forms this confession
and sustains it in community life.
</p>

<h3>3) The body metaphor ends comparison</h3>
<p>
No member is self-sufficient.
Visibility does not equal value.
Interdependence is not weakness;
it is design.
</p>

<h3>4) Honour reverses old hierarchies</h3>
<p>
Paul redirects honour toward the vulnerable.
This overturns power structures
and protects unity in the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Romans 12 — many members, one body</li>
  <li>Ephesians 4 — gifts for building up</li>
  <li>Acts 2 — Spirit-formed community</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You are not competing for usefulness.
You already belong.
The Spirit’s work in you
serves life beyond you.
Unity is not uniformity;
it is shared participation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might comparison be undermining
the joy of shared life in the body?
</p>
