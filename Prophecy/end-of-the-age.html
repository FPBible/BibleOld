<h1>End of the Age</h1>
<h2>Mosaic Age Close · Temple Order Ended · New Covenant Publicly Vindicated</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Reading Frame</strong><br />
  “The end of the age” in the Gospels is not the end of the planet.
  It is the end of a covenant administration — the Mosaic age centered in Torah, priesthood, sacrifice, and temple.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>1) What “Age” Means in Covenant Terms</h2>
<p>
The New Testament frequently uses “age” language to describe an ordered covenant world:
how worship is administered, how access to God is defined, how identity is marked, and where authority is located.
An “age” is not a geological era; it is a covenant order with a defined way of life.
</p>
<p>
That matters because “end” language follows covenant logic.
If the Mosaic covenant is a legal/worship administration with defined structures (priests, altar, calendar, temple),
then the “end of the age” is the end of that administration as the governing covenant world.
</p>
<div class="frame">
  <strong>Control Point</strong><br />
  When Jesus speaks of an “end of the age,” the default interpretive category is covenant transition,
  not cosmic annihilation.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>2) The Word Behind “Age”: Aiōn</h2>
<p>
The common “end of the world” phrasing in older church language often collapses a key distinction:
the New Testament word behind “age” is <code>aiōn</code> — an ordered era/administration.
That word choice supports covenant reading, because it naturally fits “this age” versus “the age to come”
as a contrast between covenant orders, not between “earth now” and “earth destroyed.”
</p>
<p class="note">
This is why “end of the age” is a better translation conceptually than “end of the world” when the question is covenant order.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Why Matthew 24 Locks the Meaning</h2>
<p>
Matthew 24 begins with the temple, stays in the temple’s judgment context,
and includes direct local flight commands in Judea (rooftop, field, Sabbath, winter).
This is covenant litigation attached to a real place and a real generation.
</p>
<p>
Then it time-locks fulfillment:
“Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.”
That combination (temple focus + local commands + time-lock) governs what “end of the age” means in that discourse.
</p>
<div class="frame">
  <strong>Time-Lock</strong><br />
  If “this generation” is the interpretive governor, the “end of the age” in Matthew 24 cannot be pushed into a distant future.
  It belongs to that covenant crisis horizon.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>4) Hebrews: “Aging and Near to Vanish” + “Shaking and Removal”</h2>
<p>
Hebrews describes the old covenant as “becoming old and growing aged” and “near to vanishing away.”
That is not vague theology; it is covenant status language: the old administration is obsolete and on the verge of removal.
</p>
<p>
Hebrews 12 then frames the transition as a “shaking” — removal of what can be shaken
so that what cannot be shaken remains. That is covenant removal language:
the old, shakable order gives way to the unshakable kingdom reality.
</p>
<div class="frame">
  <strong>Shakable / Unshakable</strong><br />
  “End of the age” aligns with Hebrews: the shakable covenant order is removed; the unshakable kingdom remains.
  That is not “already but not yet.” It is covenant finality.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>5) Paul’s “Ends of the Ages” (Not “End of the Planet”)</h2>
<p>
Paul tells the Corinthians that “the ends of the ages” had come upon them.
That makes no sense as a claim about the physical universe ending in Corinth.
It makes strong sense as a statement about covenant transition reaching its climactic phase in their lifetime.
</p>
<p>
This is a major control text because it shows that “age-end” language was an apostolic present-tense reality,
not a 2,000+ year postponement.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) “Last Days” and “End of the Age”</h2>
<p>
“Last days” language in the New Testament belongs to the same covenant horizon as “end of the age.”
It describes the closing phase of the Mosaic administration as the New Covenant is inaugurated in Christ
and publicly vindicated in the first-century transition.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is last days <em>of that covenant world</em>, not the last days of the physical earth.</li>
  <li>It is the end of Torah/temple jurisdiction as the governing covenant administration.</li>
  <li>It is the unveiling of Christ’s completed priesthood and open access reality.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>7) What “End of the Age” Is NOT</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not the end of the physical cosmos.</li>
  <li>Not a prophecy of modern global events as the interpretive centre.</li>
  <li>Not a license to read Matthew 24 as a generic template detached from the temple and Judea.</li>
  <li>Not a future “waiting room” where the Kingdom is postponed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">
The text itself supplies the controls: temple context, local commands, time statements, covenant jurisdiction, and apostolic usage.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8) What It Means Now (New Creation Reality)</h2>
<p>
If the Mosaic age has ended, you are not living in a mixed-admin era — part old, part new.
You live in the settled New Covenant:
open access, unshakable kingdom, Spirit-life now.
The “end” is not looming over you as threat; it is behind you as covenant history.
</p>
<div class="frame">
  <strong>Practical Covenant Result</strong><br />
  No temple gatekeeping. No priestly barrier. No law-based condemnation jurisdiction.
  Life is administered by the risen Christ — presence, access, identity, and Spirit-life as normal.
</div>
