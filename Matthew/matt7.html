<h1>Matthew 7</h1>
<h2>Judgment, Discernment, and the End of a House Built on Sand</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT07.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 7 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew 7 concludes the Sermon on the Mount.
Jesus moves from inner posture (chapters 5–6)
to decisive outcomes.
</p>
<p>
This chapter forces a choice:
<strong>which covenant foundation will stand
when judgment arrives?</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Judging without self-awareness (7:1–5)</h3>
<p>
Do not judge in order to condemn,
or you will be measured the same way.
</p>
<p>
First remove the obstruction from your own vision,
then you will see clearly enough to help another.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Judgment language exposes covenant hypocrisy, not discernment itself.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Discernment is still required (7:6)</h3>
<p>
Do not give what is holy to those who treat it with contempt.
Wisdom discerns readiness.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Grace does not eliminate discernment within covenant transition.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Ask, seek, knock—access assumed (7:7–11)</h3>
<p>
Ask, and it will be given.
Seek, and you will find.
Knock, and it will be opened.
</p>
<p>
If flawed parents know how to give good gifts,
how much more does your Father?
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Access to the Father is normalized, not restricted.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The narrow way through covenant upheaval (7:12–14)</h3>
<p>
The way that leads to life is not crowded.
Few find it.
</p>
<p>
Wide paths feel safe,
but they collapse.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> “Narrow” describes faithfulness during covenant crisis, not eternal scarcity.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>False prophets and rotten fruit (7:15–23)</h3>
<p>
Beware those who appear harmless
but speak from a destructive system.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone who claims authority
belongs to the kingdom.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Authority claims are judged by fruit, not by religious language.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The house that does not survive the storm (7:24–27)</h3>
<p>
Everyone who hears these words and acts on them
builds on rock.
</p>
<p>
Those who hear and do not act
build on sand.
When the storm comes,
the collapse is complete.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The “storm” represents covenant judgment, not random suffering.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Judge not” is about condemnation, not clarity</h3>
<p>
Jesus does not prohibit moral discernment.
He prohibits covenantal condemnation
while remaining blind to one’s own condition.
</p>
<p>
This directly confronts the religious leadership
that claimed authority while remaining untransformed.
</p>

<h3>2) Measurement language signals covenant accountability</h3>
<p>
“You will be measured” echoes prophetic justice.
</p>
<p>
The standard applied to others
reveals the covenant one trusts.
Harsh judgment signals reliance on a failing system.
</p>

<h3>3) Discernment survives the death of legalism</h3>
<p>
Matthew 7:6 guards against sentimental grace.
</p>
<p>
Truth entrusted without wisdom
becomes trampled.
Jesus insists that maturity,
not naivety,
governs New Creation life.
</p>

<h3>4) Asking assumes presence, not delay</h3>
<p>
Jesus presents prayer as an ongoing relationship,
not a plea to a distant God.
</p>
<p>
The Father’s willingness is not in question.
Access is the new norm.
</p>

<h3>5) The narrow way is historical before it is personal</h3>
<p>
In the first century,
the “wide way” was covenant comfort:
temple security,
ancestral confidence,
institutional protection.
</p>
<p>
The narrow way was allegiance to Jesus
during the collapse of that world.
</p>

<h3>6) False prophets are covenant loyalists to a dying order</h3>
<p>
Jesus is not warning about random future teachers.
</p>
<p>
He is confronting voices that resist the transition—
leaders who cling to the old while speaking God’s name.
</p>
<p>
Fruit reveals alignment.
Collapse exposes deception.
</p>

<h3>7) “Lord, Lord” is religious familiarity without obedience</h3>
<p>
Confession without transformation
does not equal participation.
</p>
<p>
Jesus separates authority claims
from covenant obedience.
Relationship is proven by alignment, not vocabulary.
</p>

<h3>8) The storm is covenant judgment</h3>
<p>
The storm imagery mirrors prophetic warnings
of coming judgment on Jerusalem and its institutions.
</p>
<p>
The issue is not individual hardship,
but which foundation survives historical judgment.
</p>

<h3>9) Authority astonishes because it bypasses the system</h3>
<p>
Jesus teaches without citation.
</p>
<p>
This shocks the crowd
because He speaks as fulfillment,
not interpreter.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 7 calls for maturity,
not fear.
</p>
<p>
New Creation life is not passive.
It hears,
discerns,
and acts.
</p>
<p>
The house that stands
is built on alignment with Christ,
not proximity to religious systems.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be using discernment
to avoid obedience?
</p>
<p>
If the storm has already revealed
which foundations fail,
what does it mean to live now
from what has already stood firm?
</p>
