<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>The Gospel Already Received (15:1–11)</h3>

<p>
Now I make known to you, brothers and sisters,
the gospel I proclaimed to you —
which you received,
in which you now stand,
and by which you are being brought safely through.
</p>

<p>
This is the message I delivered as of first importance:
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
that He was buried,
and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
He appeared to Cephas,
then to the Twelve.
After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at once,
most of whom remain alive,
though some have fallen asleep.
</p>

<p>
Then He appeared to James,
then to all the apostles.
Last of all,
as to one untimely born,
He appeared also to me.
</p>

<p>
By the grace of God I am what I am,
and His grace toward me has not been in vain.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Resurrection Is the Foundation, Not a Theory (15:12–19)</h3>

<p>
Now if Christ is proclaimed as having been raised from the dead,
how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
</p>

<p>
If there is no resurrection of the dead,
then Christ has not been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised,
our proclamation is empty
and your faith is empty.
</p>

<p>
But Christ has been raised from the dead,
so this argument collapses entirely.
</p>

<p>
If the dead are not raised,
then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished,
and we are to be pitied above all people.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Christ the Firstfruits — the Pattern Completed (15:20–28)</h3>

<p>
But now Christ has been raised from the dead —
the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
</p>

<p>
For since death came through a human,
resurrection life also comes through a human.
</p>

<p>
For just as in Adam all die,
so also in Christ all are being made alive —
each in their proper order:
Christ the firstfruits,
then those who belong to Christ,
at His revealed presence.
</p>

<p>
Then comes the end —
when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father,
after He has already abolished
all rule,
all authority,
and all power.
</p>

<p>
For He must reign
until He has placed all enemies under His feet.
The last enemy to be abolished is death.
</p>

<p>
When all things are brought under Him,
the Son Himself also is brought into harmony with the One who subjected all things,
so that God may be all in all.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Why Resurrection Shapes Present Life (15:29–34)</h3>

<p>
Otherwise, what will those do who are baptised for the dead?
If the dead are not raised at all,
why are people baptised on their behalf?
</p>

<p>
Why are we in danger every hour?
I face death daily —
as surely as I boast in you in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>

<p>
If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons,
what did it gain me?
If the dead are not raised,
“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”
</p>

<p>
Do not be misled:
bad company corrupts good character.
Come back to your senses as you ought,
and stop sinning —
for some have no knowledge of God.
I say this to your shame.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Nature of Resurrection Life (15:35–49)</h3>

<p>
But someone will ask,
“How are the dead raised?
With what kind of body do they come?”
</p>

<p>
What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
And what you sow is not the body that will be,
but a bare seed.
</p>

<p>
God gives it a body as He has chosen —
and to each seed its own body.
</p>

<p>
So it is with resurrection:
what is sown perishable
is raised imperishable;
</p>

<p>
it is sown in dishonour,
raised in glory;
sown in weakness,
raised in power;
</p>

<p>
sown a natural body,
raised a spiritual body.
</p>

<p>
The first man, Adam, became a living soul;
the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
</p>

<p>
The first man was from the earth, earthly;
the second man is from heaven.
As we have borne the image of the earthly,
we are now bearing the image of the heavenly.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Transformation Completed (15:50–58)</h3>

<p>
Now I tell you this:
flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
</p>

<p>
Look — I tell you a mystery:
we are not all going to sleep,
but we are all being transformed,
</p>

<p>
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,
at the last trumpet.
</p>

<p>
For the trumpet sounded,
the dead were raised imperishable,
and we were transformed.
</p>

<p>
When the perishable clothed itself with imperishability,
and the mortal clothed itself with immortality,
then the saying was fulfilled:
“Death has been swallowed up in victory.”
</p>

<p>
“Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?”
</p>

<p>
The sting of death is sin,
and the power of sin was the Law.
But thanks be to God,
who has already given us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters,
be steadfast,
immovable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord,
knowing that your labour in the Lord is not in vain.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Some in Corinth were denying resurrection,
likely redefining it as irrelevant or purely spiritual.
Paul responds by showing that resurrection
is the backbone of the gospel
and the completion of the covenant transition.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Resurrection is covenantal before it is biological</h3>
<p>
Paul draws on Israel’s story of death and restoration.
Resurrection language speaks of movement
from Law-bound death
into Spirit-filled life.
Physical imagery serves covenant meaning.
</p>

<h3>2) “At His presence” refers to covenant vindication</h3>
<p>
This is not a distant global event.
It refers to Christ’s revealed reign and judgment
within the apostolic generation,
culminating in the defeat of death’s authority.
</p>

<h3>3) “The end” is the end of the old covenant order</h3>
<p>
Paul defines “the end” as the abolition of hostile powers —
Law, sin, death —
not the end of the universe.
The kingdom is already handed over,
God already reigns fully.
</p>

<h3>4) Victory over death is present reality</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks in accomplished terms:
death <em>has been</em> swallowed up,
victory <em>has been</em> given.
Believers live from resurrection,
not toward it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Firstfruits”:</strong> guarantee and pattern of completed harvest.</li>
  <li><strong>“Presence” (parousia):</strong> revealed authority, not physical travel.</li>
  <li><strong>“Last trumpet”:</strong> covenant signal marking completion.</li>
  <li><strong>“Flesh and blood”:</strong> mortal covenant identity, not material body.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Resurrection is not postponed hope.
It is the ground you stand on.
Life has replaced death,
Spirit has replaced Law,
and God is now all in all.
This is the world you are living in.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
If resurrection is already accomplished,
what fears or limits am I still allowing death to impose on my thinking?
</p>
