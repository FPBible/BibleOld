<h1>Hebrews 2</h1>
<h2>Do Not Drift · Shared Humanity · Death Defeated</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Pay Close Attention (Hebrews 2:1–4)</h2>

<p><strong>2:1</strong> For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</p>

<p><strong>2:2–3</strong> If the word spoken through angels proved firm, and every transgression received a just consequence, how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation — which was first spoken by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard?</p>

<p><strong>2:4</strong> God also bore witness by signs, wonders, various works of power, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — The World to Come Is Not Angelic (Hebrews 2:5–9)</h2>

<p><strong>2:5</strong> For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</p>

<p><strong>2:6–8</strong> Someone has testified, saying, “What is man that You are mindful of him? You made him for a little while lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honour, putting everything under his feet.” In subjecting all things to him, nothing is left outside his control — though at present we do not yet see everything subjected.</p>

<p><strong>2:9</strong> But we see Jesus — crowned with glory and honour because of the suffering of death — so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Bringing Many Sons to Glory (Hebrews 2:10–13)</h2>

<p><strong>2:10</strong> It was fitting that God — for whom and through whom all things exist — should make the pioneer of their salvation complete through sufferings, in bringing many sons to glory.</p>

<p><strong>2:11–12</strong> Both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all come from one source. That is why He is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.</p>

<p><strong>2:13</strong> Again, “I will put My trust in Him,” and again, “Here am I and the children God has given Me.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary — Death Destroyed, Fear Broken (Hebrews 2:14–18)</h2>

<p><strong>2:14–15</strong> Since the children share in flesh and blood, He likewise shared in the same — so that through death He might destroy the one holding the power of death, that is, the adversary, and free those who were held in lifelong slavery by fear of death.</p>

<p><strong>2:16–17</strong> Surely it is not angels He helps, but the offspring of Abraham. Therefore He had to be made like His brothers and sisters in every way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest.</p>

<p><strong>2:18</strong> Because He Himself suffered when tested, He is able to help those who are being tested.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Hebrews 2 issues the first explicit warning of the letter.
The danger is not intellectual doubt — it is drift.
To loosen one’s grip on the Son while the old covenant world is collapsing
is to place oneself back under a system that cannot give life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant & Death Defeat)</h2>

<h3>1) “Drift” is passive retreat, not active rebellion</h3>
<p>
The warning is subtle but severe.
No one plans apostasy.
Drift happens when urgency is ignored
and old structures start to feel safer than Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) “Escape” is covenant survival language</h3>
<p>
This is not about hell.
It is about surviving the coming covenant judgment
by remaining anchored to the Son rather than the temple system.
</p>

<h3>3) “The world to come” is the New Covenant order</h3>
<p>
This is not heaven-after-death language.
It is the inaugurated New Creation world
that replaces angel-mediated Law with Son-mediated life.
</p>

<h3>4) Psalm 8 is fulfilled in Jesus and shared with humanity</h3>
<p>
Human vocation — glory, honour, rule —
is restored in Christ.
What was lost under Adam is reclaimed in the Son,
and shared with “many sons.”
</p>

<h3>5) Death’s power is broken, not postponed</h3>
<p>
Death ruled through accusation and fear.
By entering death and exhausting its claim,
Jesus strips it of authority.
Fear no longer governs covenant identity.
</p>

<h3>6) “The adversary” is not a cosmic equal</h3>
<p>
The text speaks functionally.
The “one holding the power of death” is the accuser —
the system of condemnation operating through Law and fear.
It is defeated, not negotiated with.
</p>

<h3>7) Shared humanity grounds priestly mercy</h3>
<p>
The Son does not mediate from distance.
He helps because He shared fully in human weakness
and passed through suffering into glory.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Hebrews 2 dismantles fear-based religion.
Death no longer defines destiny.
Accusation no longer defines identity.
</p>

<p>
You are not invited to cling harder to systems —
you are invited to live freely as a son or daughter
in a world already reclaimed in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be slowly drifting back toward fear, performance, or safety —
instead of resting in the Son who has already passed through death for me?
</p>
