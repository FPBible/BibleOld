<h1>Matthew 10</h1>
<h2>The Commissioning of the Twelve and the Call to the Lost Sheep</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://www.lsvbible.com/" target="_blank">Matthew 10 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew 10 marks the transition from Jesus working alone to Jesus working through His body. 
He empowers the twelve disciples to perform the same "Finished Work" signs He displayed in chapters 8 and 9. 
</p>
<p>
This chapter contains the <strong>Specific Commission</strong>: a focused strike on the heart of the Old Covenant structure to announce that the Kingdom of Heaven is "at hand"—meaning the old age is about to expire.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Delegated Authority (10:1–4)</h3>
<p>
Jesus called His twelve disciples together and gave them authority over unclean spirits and every kind of disease. 
He didn't just give them a message; He gave them the power of the New Creation to displace the decay of the Old.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Focused Mission: To the Lost Sheep (10:5–15)</h3>
<p>
Jesus sent them out with specific orders: "Do not go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans yet. 
Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
As you go, announce this reality: 'The Kingdom of Heaven has drawn near!' 
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. 
You received this Life freely; give it away freely."
</p>
<p>
He told them to travel light, relying on the hospitality of those who welcomed the New Message. 
"If a house is worthy, let your peace remain there. 
If a town rejects you, shake the dust off your feet. 
In the day of judgment, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> This mission was the "First Alert" to Israel. The judgment mentioned (v. 15) points directly to the historical devastation of those who rejected the transition in AD 70.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sheep Among Wolves: The Coming Persecution (10:16–25)</h3>
<p>
"I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. Be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves. 
Expect resistance from the old religious systems; they will hand you over to councils and scourge you in their synagogues. 
But do not worry about what to say. In that moment, it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."
</p>
<p>
He warned that this message would cause division even in families. 
"You will be hated by all for My Name’s sake, but the one who endures to the end will be saved. 
When they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. 
I tell you truly: <strong>You will not have finished going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Verse 23 is a crucial "time stamp." It proves that the "Coming of the Son of Man" was a first-century event, occurring before the disciples could even finish evangelizing Israel.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Fearless Confession (10:26–33)</h3>
<p>
"Do not fear them. Everything that is currently hidden by the old system is about to be revealed. 
Do not fear those who can only kill the body; fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna—the fire of judgment. 
Are not sparrows cheap? Yet not one falls without your Father knowing. 
Even the hairs of your head are numbered. So, acknowledge Me before men, and I will acknowledge you before My Father in the heavens."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Gehenna (v. 28) was a literal valley outside Jerusalem, used here as a symbol of the national judgment and "consumption" of the old order.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Sword of Division (10:34–39)</h3>
<p>
"Do not think I came to bring a worldly peace to the old system. I came to bring a sword—a division between the Old and the New. 
A person's enemies may be those of their own household who cling to the old ways. 
Whoever loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. 
Whoever finds his life in the old world will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find the True Life."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "sword" is the cutting away of the Old Covenant identity. To "find life" in the doomed temple system was to lose it in the coming judgment.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Receiving the Reward (10:40–42)</h3>
<p>
"Whoever receives you receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me. 
Whoever supports a prophet or a righteous person because of who they are will share in their reward. 
Even a cup of cold water given to one of these little ones will not go unrewarded."
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Limited vs. Great Commission</h3>
<p>
In Matthew 10, the mission is strictly to Israel ("the lost sheep"). 
This was necessary because the Old Covenant had to be legally and prophetically addressed before the New Covenant could be fully ratified for the whole world. 
The disciples were the "divorce papers" served to the old system.
</p>

<h3>2) The Time-Stamp of Verse 23</h3>
<p>
Jesus explicitly tells the twelve that the "Coming of the Son of Man" would happen before they finished their circuit of Israel's cities. 
This refutes any "future" or "delayed" coming. 
The Coming of the Son of Man was His arrival in judgment upon Jerusalem in AD 70, vindicating His followers and ending the Old Covenant age.
</p>

<h3>3) Gehenna: National, not Eternal, Fire</h3>
<p>
Jesus uses "Gehenna" (translated as hell in many bibles) to warn His Jewish audience. 
Gehenna was a place they could see—a valley of fire and refuse. 
It represented the total social and physical destruction that was coming upon the Christ-rejecting generation.
</p>

<h3>4) Endurance to "The End"</h3>
<p>
"The end" (v. 22) refers to the <em>sunteleia</em>—the "end of the age" (the Mosaic age). 
Those who remained faithful through the transition, leaving the "house built on sand" (Matt 7), were "saved" (delivered) from the historical catastrophe of AD 70.
</p>

<h3>5) The Reward of Alignment</h3>
<p>
By receiving the disciples, people were choosing alignment with the New Creation. 
In the "Finished Work," our reward is found in our union with Christ. 
To receive His messengers is to receive His reality.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 10 teaches us that the authority of Christ is delegated to His body. 
We do not operate on our own strength, but from the authority of the Father. 
The "sword" of the Word has already performed its work, separating us from the dead works of the past 
and establishing us in the fearless Life of the Spirit.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still fearing "those who can kill the body," or am I resting in the Father's absolute care for the New Creation?
</p>
<p>
If the "Coming of the Son of Man" has already occurred, how does that change my view of my purpose in the world today?
</p>
