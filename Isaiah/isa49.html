      <h2>1. Immediate Context</h2>
      <p>
        Isaiah 49 contains the second of Isaiah's four "Servant Songs." In this stunning passage, the Servant speaks in the first person. He reveals that God has named Him "Israel," yet paradoxically, His specific mission is to save and restore the nation of Israel. This establishes the profound theological reality that the Servant (Jesus) will succeed where the nation of Israel failed. He becomes the true, faithful Israelite. Furthermore, God declares that saving national Israel is "too small a thing" for this Servant; His mandate is to be a light to the farthest reaches of the Gentile world. The chapter concludes with God comforting Zion, promising an unstoppable ingathering of children that will rebuild her ruins.

      <div class="scripture-text">
        <span class="v-num">1</span> Listen, islands, to me. Listen, you peoples, from afar: Yahweh has called me from the womb; from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.<br />
        <span class="v-num">2</span> He has made my mouth like a sharp sword. He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand. He has made me a polished shaft. He has kept me close in his quiver.<br />
        <span class="v-num">3</span> He said to me, “You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">4</span> But I said, “I have labored in vain. I have spent my strength in vain for nothing; yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh, and my reward with my God.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">5</span> Now Yahweh says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and to gather Israel to him, for I am honorable in Yahweh’s eyes, and my God has become my strength.<br />
        <span class="v-num">6</span> Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give you as a light to the nations, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">7</span> Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: “Kings shall see and rise up, princes, and they shall worship, because of Yahweh who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">8</span> Yahweh says, “I have answered you in an acceptable time. I have helped you in a day of salvation. I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,<br />
        <span class="v-num">9</span> saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’; to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’ “They shall feed along the paths, and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.<br />
        <span class="v-num">10</span> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them, for he who has mercy on them will lead them. He will guide them by springs of water.<br />
        <span class="v-num">11</span> I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.<br />
        <span class="v-num">12</span> Behold, these shall come from afar, and behold, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Sinim.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">13</span> Sing, heavens, and be joyful, earth! Break out into singing, mountains! For Yahweh has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted.<br />
        <span class="v-num">14</span> But Zion said, “Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">15</span> “Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you!<br />
        <span class="v-num">16</span> Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands. Your walls are continually before me.<br />
        <span class="v-num">17</span> Your children make haste. Your destroyers and those who devastated you shall depart from you.<br />
        <span class="v-num">18</span> Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live,” says Yahweh, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and dress yourself with them, like a bride.<br />
        <span class="v-num">19</span> “For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your destroyed land, surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants; and those who swallowed you up will be far away.<br />
        <span class="v-num">20</span> The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears, ‘The place is too small for me. Give me a place to live in.’<br />
        <span class="v-num">21</span> Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has brought these up? Behold, I was left alone. Where did these come from?’”<br />
        <span class="v-num">22</span> The Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.<br />
        <span class="v-num">23</span> Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed.”<br />
        <span class="v-num">24</span> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?<br />
        <span class="v-num">25</span> But Yahweh says, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.<br />
        <span class="v-num">26</span> I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine. Then all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”

      <h2>3. Fulfillment Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Israel Condensed:</strong> The Servant is called "Israel" (v. 3), representing Jesus Christ who fulfills the covenant mandate that the physical nation failed to achieve.</li>
        <li><strong>Too Light a Thing:</strong> The inclusion of the Gentiles was not a "Plan B." God explicitly declares that saving only the Jews was "too light a thing" for the Messiah's glory (v. 6).</li>
        <li><strong>Apostolic Commission:</strong> In Acts 13:47, the Apostle Paul quotes verse 6 directly, stating that his ministry to the Gentiles is the active fulfillment of this passage.</li>
        <li><strong>The Day of Salvation:</strong> The Apostle Paul quotes verse 8 in 2 Corinthians 6:2, declaring to the first-century church, "Behold, <em>now</em> is the day of salvation."</li>

      <h2>4. Annotations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>mouth like a sharp sword</strong> — The Word of the Servant is His weapon of judgment and truth (matching Revelation 1:16 and 19:15).</li>
        <li><strong>labored in vain</strong> — The Servant's initial rejection by His own people. His earthly ministry appeared to end in absolute failure on the cross.</li>
        <li><strong>abhorred by the nation</strong> — A clear prophecy of the rejection of Christ by the first-century Jewish leadership.</li>
        <li><strong>engraved you on the palms</strong> — A profound image of permanent covenantal memory, beautifully realized in the nail-scarred hands of Jesus.</li>
        <li><strong>too small for the inhabitants</strong> — The borders of the Old Covenant were restricted and exclusive. The borders of the New Jerusalem expand to accommodate the massive influx of Gentile believers.</li>

      <h2>5. Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

      <h3>1) The Servant Embodies True Israel (vv. 1–3)</h3>
      <p>
        Verse 3 contains a profound theological paradox. God says to the Servant, "You are my servant, Israel." Yet, in verse 5, this same Servant is commissioned to "bring Jacob again to him, and to gather Israel to him." How can the Servant be Israel, and yet save Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the principle of covenantal condensation. The physical nation of Israel failed its vocation to be the faithful son and the light to the world. Therefore, God "condensed" the entire calling of the nation into one faithful, representative Israelite: Jesus Christ. Jesus succeeds where the nation failed. He goes into Egypt and comes out. He goes into the wilderness and resists temptation. He is the true Vine. By being "in Christ," believers become part of the true Israel of God (Galatians 6:16).
      </p>

      <h3>2) Apparent Failure and Glorious Vindication (vv. 4, 7)</h3>
      <p>
        The Servant admits, "I have labored in vain. I have spent my strength in vain for nothing" (v. 4). He is "deeply despised, abhorred by the nation" (v. 7). This perfectly forecasts the crucifixion. To the natural eye, Jesus' ministry ended in absolute disaster. He was rejected by His own people and executed as a criminal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But Isaiah acknowledges this rejection without redefining the calling. Fulfillment often looks like loss before it looks like victory. The Servant trusts God for the verdict, and God promises that ultimately, kings and princes will bow down to Him. The resurrection was God's supreme vindication of the despised Servant.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Gentile Inclusion is Not "Plan B" (v. 6)</h3>
      <p>
        Dispensational theology often teaches that God's primary goal was to establish a Jewish kingdom, and the Gentile "Church Age" is a temporary parenthesis because the Jews rejected Jesus. Isaiah 49 utterly destroys this theory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob... I will also give you as a light to the nations, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        God declares that saving ethnic Israel alone is "too small" for the magnitude of what the Messiah accomplishes. The inclusion of the Gentiles was the primary, prophesied goal from the very beginning. In Acts 13:47, when Paul is preaching in Antioch and the Jews reject his message, Paul immediately turns to the Gentiles and quotes Isaiah 49:6, declaring: "For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, 'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles.'" Paul viewed the New Covenant Church as the direct fulfillment of this verse.
      </p>

      <h3>4) The Covenant Embodied in a Person (v. 8)</h3>
      <p>
        God promises the Servant, "I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people." Once again, Isaiah reiterates the core of New Covenant theology: the covenant is not a set of stone tablets; the covenant is a Person. To have the Son is to have the covenant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle Paul quotes the first half of this verse in 2 Corinthians 6:2: <em>"For he says, 'At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.' Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation."</em> Paul applies Isaiah's prophecy directly to his present, first-century audience. The day of salvation had arrived.
      </p>

      <h3>5) Zion's Fear and God's Memory (vv. 14–16)</h3>
            <p>
        Zion laments, "Yahweh has forsaken me" (v. 14). God responds with the most tender, maternal imagery in Scripture. Even if a nursing mother could forget her child, God will not forget His covenant people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands." This points beautifully forward to the cross, where the hands of the Servant were pierced. The New Creation rests entirely on divine faithfulness, not human perception or performance. 
      </p>

      <h3>6) The Shocking Ingathering of the Children (vv. 18–21)</h3>
      <p>
        Zion is pictured as a bereaved, solitary mother whose city has been destroyed. But suddenly, an innumerable multitude of children arrives. The influx is so massive that the borders of the city are "too small for the inhabitants" (v. 19). Zion is bewildered, asking, "Who has conceived these for me? Where did these come from?" (v. 21).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the glory of the Gentile inclusion. The Old Covenant system (physical Jerusalem) was exclusive, small, and bounded by strict ethnic lines. But the New Covenant Jerusalem (the Bride of Christ) is flooded with believers from every tribe, tongue, and nation. The children born of the Spirit far outnumber the children born of the flesh (as Paul argues from Isaiah 54 in Galatians 4).
      </p>

      <h3>7) What This Is NOT Saying</h3>
      <p>
        To grasp the majesty of Isaiah 49, we must avoid filtering it through modern political lenses.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This chapter is <strong>not</strong> about the modern secular state of Israel repopulating the physical land in the Middle East. It is about the spiritual New Jerusalem being filled with believers from all nations.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> predicting that modern politicians (kings and queens) will literally lick the dirt off the boots of Jewish citizens (v. 23). It is poetic imagery demonstrating the absolute triumph and supremacy of the New Covenant Kingdom over all earthly authorities.</li>
      </ul>
