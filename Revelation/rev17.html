<h1>Revelation 17</h1>
<h2>Babylon Unmasked</h2>

<p class="hide-element note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV17.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 17 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 16 completed the bowls and declared, “It is done.”
Revelation 17 now zooms in on what is being judged:
“Babylon,” the seductive, wealthy, persecuting order that intoxicated the nations
and shed the blood of the faithful.
This is not a detour. It is an unveiling: God names the system before He topples it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Prophecy</h2>

<h3>The Woman on the Beast (17:1–6)</h3>
<p>
One of the bowl messengers shows John “the judgment of the great prostitute,”
who sits over many waters—wide influence over peoples and nations.
Kings commit immorality with her, and the land’s inhabitants become intoxicated
with her luxurious corruption.
</p>
<p>
She is seen seated on a scarlet beast covered with blasphemous names,
with seven heads and ten horns.
She is dressed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and jewels,
holding a golden cup full of abominations.
A name is written on her forehead: “Babylon the Great.”
</p>
<p>
She is drunk with the blood of the holy ones and witnesses of Jesus.
John is stunned—not because evil exists, but because it is so polished and religiously confident.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Mystery Explained: Heads, Horns, and a Short Time (17:7–14)</h3>
<p>
The messenger explains that the beast “was, and is not, and is about to come,”
a parody of divine language—oppressive power mimicking sovereignty.
</p>
<p>
The seven heads represent seven mountains and also seven kings.
The vision speaks of sequence, limited time, and impending collapse.
The horns represent allied rulers who share power briefly with the beast.
They make war on the Lamb, but the Lamb overcomes them—
because He is Lord of lords and King of kings—
and His called and faithful people share in His victory.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Babylon Turned On: Self-Destruction of the System (17:15–18)</h3>
<p>
The waters represent peoples and nations under her influence.
The beast and its allies will hate the woman, strip her, devour her, and burn her.
God uses the internal fractures of evil to execute His verdict.
</p>
<p>
The woman is “the great city” that reigns over the kings of the earth—
a present-tense identification in John’s own world.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> Babylon is a first-century covenantally-identified persecuting order,
not a future global one-world government. The timing language is short, near, and imminent within the original audience’s horizon.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Babylon is covenant seduction: wealth + compromise + persecution</h3>
<p>
The prostitute image is prophetic shorthand for covenant unfaithfulness and corrupt alliance.
Babylon is not “bad culture in general.”
It is a specific system that sells comfort at the price of loyalty,
and it persecutes those who refuse the deal.
</p>

<h3>2) “Many waters” means broad influence, not geography</h3>
<p>
Revelation interprets itself: the waters are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
Babylon’s reach is political and cultural—she shapes appetites and allegiances.
</p>

<h3>3) The beast carries her: political power supports religious-economic corruption</h3>
<p>
The woman rides the beast. That means seduction and coercion work together:
glamour plus force. People are not only tempted; they are pressured.
Revelation is exposing how systems operate.
</p>

<h3>4) “Drunk with the blood” identifies the true crime</h3>
<p>
The core charge is persecution. Babylon kills witnesses.
This is why the book insists on judgment:
God is answering the martyr cry and vindicating faithful testimony.
</p>

<h3>5) The system collapses by internal hatred</h3>
<p>
God judges Babylon partly by turning her allies against her.
Evil is unstable. What it builds, it eventually devours.
The vision shows that Babylon’s fall is not accidental; it is ordained.
</p>

<h3>6) The Lamb wins—and His people share the win</h3>
<p>
Revelation does not end in fear.
The Lamb is already Lord of lords.
The faithful are not spectators; they are “called, chosen, and faithful.”
Victory is defined by allegiance maintained under pressure.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 17 teaches discernment.
Babylon is not always ugly; she is often dressed in success and respectability.
New Creation people refuse the cup of compromise.
They keep allegiance clean when the system offers comfort in exchange for silence.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where does “Babylon” try to buy my loyalty—through comfort, money, status, or fear?
What is one specific compromise I need to refuse this week so my witness stays clean?
