<h1>Matthew 5</h1>
<h2>The Kingdom Manifesto and the Passing of the Old Heaven and Earth</h2>

<p class="note">
  Read the chapter in LSV (eBible): <a href="https://ebible.org/englsv/MAT05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 5 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus goes up a mountain and sits to teach, deliberately echoing Sinai—but this is not “Moses 2.0.” He is the covenant fulfiller and the King
announcing the shape of life in the Kingdom that is drawing near for that generation. Matthew 5 is not a timeless “improve your behavior”
speech; it is the manifesto of the New Covenant community being formed in the closing days of the Mosaic age, right before the old covenant
“heaven and earth” would pass away (AD 70).

<h2>Scripture</h2>
<div class="scripture-text">
  <p><span class="v-num">1</span>And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mountain, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him, <span class="v-num">2</span>and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">3</span>“Happy the poor in spirit—because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="v-num">4</span>Happy the mourning—because they shall be comforted. <span class="v-num">5</span>Happy the meek—because they shall inherit the land. <span class="v-num">6</span>Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness—because they shall be filled. <span class="v-num">7</span>Happy the kind—because they shall find kindness. <span class="v-num">8</span>Happy the clean in heart—because they shall see God. <span class="v-num">9</span>Happy the peacemakers—because they shall be called Sons of God. <span class="v-num">10</span>Happy those persecuted for righteousness’ sake—because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="v-num">11</span>Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake— <span class="v-num">12</span>rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward [is] great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">13</span>Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt may lose savor, in what shall it be salted? It is good for nothing thenceforth, except to be cast without, and trodden down by men. <span class="v-num">14</span>Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a hill cannot be hid, <span class="v-num">15</span>nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house; <span class="v-num">16</span>so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who [is] in the heavens.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">17</span>Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets; I did not come to throw down, but to fulfill; <span class="v-num">18</span>for, verily I say to you, till that <strong>the heaven and the earth</strong> may pass away, <strong>one iota or one tittle</strong> may not pass away from the law, till that all may happen. <span class="v-num">19</span>Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands—the least—and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="v-num">20</span>For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound more than [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">21</span>Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment; <span class="v-num">22</span>but I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council, and whoever may say, Fool, shall be in danger of the <strong>hell of the fire</strong>. <span class="v-num">23</span>If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar, and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee, <span class="v-num">24</span>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go—first be reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift. <span class="v-num">25</span>Be agreeing with thine opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and into prison thou mayest be cast, <span class="v-num">26</span>verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence till that thou mayest pay the last farthing.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">27</span>Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not commit adultery; <span class="v-num">28</span>but I say to you, that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in his heart. <span class="v-num">29</span>But if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to <strong>gehenna</strong>. <span class="v-num">30</span>And if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to <strong>gehenna</strong>. <span class="v-num">31</span>And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce; <span class="v-num">32</span>but I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">33</span>Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths; <span class="v-num">34</span>but I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God, <span class="v-num">35</span>nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King, <span class="v-num">36</span>nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not able one hair to make white or black; <span class="v-num">37</span>but let your word be, Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay, and that which is more than these is of the evil.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">38</span>Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; <span class="v-num">39</span>but I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other; <span class="v-num">40</span>and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and to take thy coat, suffer him to take the cloak also. <span class="v-num">41</span>And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two, <span class="v-num">42</span>to him who is asking of thee give, and him who is wishing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away.</p>

  <p><span class="v-num">43</span>Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine enemy; <span class="v-num">44</span>but I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you and persecuting you, <span class="v-num">45</span>that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth rain on righteous and unrighteous. <span class="v-num">46</span>For if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same? <span class="v-num">47</span>And if ye may salute your brethren only, what abundant thing do ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers so? <span class="v-num">48</span>Ye shall therefore be <strong>perfect</strong>, as your Father who [is] in the heavens is perfect.”</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Mountain Is Sinai Revisited—But the Speaker Is Greater Than Moses</h3>
<p>
Matthew intentionally frames this sermon as a mountain moment. Israel received Torah at Sinai through Moses; now Israel hears the Kingdom
manifesto through the Messiah. But the point is not that Jesus repeats Sinai with stricter rules. The point is covenant transition: the old
order is nearing its appointed end, and the King is forming a people whose life is rooted in God’s character rather than in a temporary
administration of written ordinances.
</p>
<p>
That’s why the Beatitudes are not “how to earn salvation.” They describe the kind of people God is gathering as the age turns: the poor in
spirit (not self-sufficient), the mourners (grieving the brokenness of Israel’s condition), the meek (not power-grabbers), the hungerers for
righteousness (longing for covenant rightness), the merciful, the pure, the peacemakers. This is the remnant ethic. These are the people who
will not cling to the old identity markers when the system begins to shake. They will inherit “the land” as the covenant promise comes to its
fulfilled, Kingdom expression—life secured in Messiah rather than in a threatened temple-world.
</p>

<h3>2) Salt, Light, and the “City on a Hill”: New Covenant Identity Before AD 70</h3>
<p>
Jesus tells His disciples they are “salt of the earth” and “light of the world,” and He describes them as a city that cannot be hidden. This
is not modern self-help branding. In first-century covenant terms, Israel was meant to be God’s light among the nations, yet the leadership had
turned the covenant into a mechanism of exclusion, pride, and control. Jesus is reconstituting Israel around Himself. The Kingdom community is
the true witness—visible, public, and undeniable.
</p>
<p>
“Let your light shine… that they may glorify your Father” is not a call to perform for applause. It is a call to embody the life of the coming
covenant while the old covenant still stands and is being confronted. This is one reason Matthew 5 belongs inside the AD 30–70 transition
window: the “city” Jesus forms is set against the old city that will soon be judged. The contrast is built into the sermon.
</p>

<h3>3) Fulfill, Not Abolish: The Law’s Deadline Is Built Into the Text</h3>
<p>
Matthew 5:17–20 is the center hinge. Jesus did not come to “throw down” the Law and Prophets, but to fulfill. Fulfillment means completion to
the intended goal. And then Jesus attaches the Law’s duration to a condition: “till that the heaven and the earth may pass away… till that all
may happen.” If “heaven and earth” is treated as the physical universe, the Law remains forever and the New Covenant becomes a vague spiritual
overlay. But Scripture repeatedly uses “heaven and earth” as covenant courtroom language (the creation-witness framework applied to Israel’s
covenant order). In that idiom, the Law remains until the Mosaic covenant world reaches its appointed end.
</p>
<p>
That is exactly what happened historically: the temple (the central “heavenly” symbol of access) was destroyed, the sacrificial system ended,
the genealogical administration collapsed, and the Mosaic age was publicly terminated in AD 70. Once “all” that was to happen did happen, the
“jot and tittle” covenant-code no longer functioned as binding administration. A fulfilled contract is not still in force as a contract. Jesus
did not destroy the Law; He completed it and brought it to its covenant finish line.
</p>

<h3>4) The “But I Say to You” Sections: Not a Harder Torah—A New Covenant Heart</h3>
<p>
The six “You heard… but I say…” sections are often preached as “Jesus raises the bar so you fail more.” That reading misses the covenant
movement. Jesus is not tightening Sinai; He is exposing what the Law pointed to but could not produce: heart-level wholeness and relational
rightness. Murder is not merely an act; it is the fruit of contempt. Adultery is not merely an act; it is the fruit of covetous desire. Oaths
reveal divided integrity. Retaliation reveals a community trained by grievance. Enemy-love reveals whether God’s character is actually being
formed in a people.
</p>
<p>
Notice the practical covenant setting: “bring thy gift to the altar” assumes temple life is still functioning during Jesus’ ministry. Jesus is
speaking to people who are still inside the Mosaic administration but are being prepared to live beyond it. His instruction is deeply
relational because the New Covenant is not a stone-tablet system; it is a Spirit-written life. The aim is not anxiety-driven perfectionism; it
is covenant maturity—whole-hearted love that reflects the Father.
</p>

<h3>5) Gehenna as Covenant Warning: Real Judgment in a Real First-Century Horizon</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ warnings about “hell of the fire” and being cast into Gehenna are not generic afterlife threats floating outside the chapter. They are
covenant warnings inside an imminent transition. Jerusalem was heading toward a catastrophic covenant reckoning. Jesus repeatedly warns His
generation about judgment, siege, and removal of the old order’s security.
</p>
<p>
In Matthew 5, the Gehenna warnings are attached to destructive, community-killing sins: contempt, lust-driven betrayal, and the refusal to cut
off what causes stumbling. The point is not “God is waiting to torture you later.” The point is: if you cling to the old world’s violence,
hypocrisy, and internal corruption, you are aligning yourself with the doomed trajectory of that covenant system. Jesus is calling His people to
escape the coming devastation by embracing the Kingdom way—reconciliation, integrity, non-retaliation, and enemy-love. That is not soft. It is
how you survive a covenant collapse and become the light of the new world.
</p>

<h3>6) “Perfect” as Covenant Completeness: The Maturity of New Covenant Love</h3>
<p>
The chapter ends: “Ye shall therefore be perfect…” The word means complete, whole, mature—love brought to its intended fullness. In context,
the contrast is clear: the old covenant mindset could love insiders and hate enemies; the Father’s love is indiscriminate generosity—sun and
rain on both righteous and unrighteous. Jesus is not demanding flawless rule-keeping; He is revealing the finished aim of covenant life: a
people conformed to the Father’s character.
</p>
<p>
This matters for your Matthew audit goal: Matthew 5 is not a vague spiritual ideal. It is covenant formation in a time-stamped transition that
ends with the passing of the old “heaven and earth.” The sermon is not “still pending.” It is the Kingdom constitution given while the old age
was still standing, preparing a people to live as the New Creation community once the old administration was removed.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You are not living under “jot and tittle” administration. The covenant “heaven and earth” that kept the Mosaic code in force has passed, and
you live in the established Kingdom as a city that shines. Matthew 5 is not a burden to earn standing; it is the description of Spirit-formed
life flowing from sonship—integrity, reconciliation, purity of heart, non-retaliation, and love that reflects the Father.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I still trying to relate to God through old-contract thinking—measuring myself by “jots and tittles”—instead of living from the
settled reality that Christ fulfilled the old order and formed me to live from New Covenant love?
